[Tourist 11:] How does the train to the grand canyon work?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] The Grand Canyon Railway departs from Williams each morning around 9am it is about a three hour ride to the Grand Canyon where you get off the train and have about 4 hours to explore the Grand Canyon on your own or you can add a bus tour to see the canyon during this time. Then you will get back on the train and arrive back in Williams at about 5:30pm.
