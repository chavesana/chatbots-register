[Tourist 26:] Hi, does the tourist center have a city map?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. Yes, the Flagstaff Visitor Center has two city maps. There is the Discovery Map, which is more geared toward visitors and highlights the important attractions, and there is also a map produced by the Chamber of Commerce that has all the streets on it that is more for relocation.
[Tourist 26:] We're wondering what are some notable buildings along route 66 to visit while going through the city
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] There are definitely some good ones! Downtown has managed to preserve more of the original route 66 buildings than further out in town. If you sotp by the Visitor Center, there is a Route 66 walking tour brochure that you can pick up to see and read about them.
Outside of downtown, definitely stop by the Museum Club in East Flagstaff. It opened around the same time as Route 66 was founded, and they still play country music there today.
[Tourist 26:] Interesting. We've read through one of the tours, we'll have to get our own and check it out.
It was mentioned was the underground tunnels dug by Chinese residents and later on the steam power plant, are there any areas to see these tunnels?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] The tunnels still exist, but unfortunately they aren't accessible to the public any more. I know that our local historian, Johnny Anaya, tried to organize a tour of them a few years ago, but they have been blocked off and walled up in many places.
I've been down to the basement of Blendz, a wine bar on Aspen Ave, which still has access to its part of the tunnel, but it isn't open to the general public.
It may be worth stopping in to ask, though!
[Tourist 26:] Thanks for the information.
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Of course.
Did you have any other questions?
[Tourist 26:] No, that's all. thank you so much
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] ok, have a good day!
