[Tourist 37:] Hi
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
How can I help/
[Tourist 34:] Will the Grand Canyon be crowded tomorrow?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Probably. Arriving earlier is better. You can check the lines at <<link>>
[Tourist 37:] Cool!
Is it hot there?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] It's roughly about the same temperature as Flagstaff. The bottom of the canyon is 20 degrees hotter, which is why it is not recommended to hike it in the summer.
[Tourist 37:] <<like>>
