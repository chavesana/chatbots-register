[Tourist 21:] Hi
What are some interesting natural landmarks to see in Sedona?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. Some good options in Sedona are Grasshopper Point, Chapel of the Holy Cross has a beautiful view, and the trails near Courthouse Butte and Castle Rock.
[Tourist 21:] Can I see it all in one day?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You would have a very full day, but you can do most everything all in one day. I definitely recommend going on one hike, if you're able, to really get a feel for the area. It is very beautiful.
