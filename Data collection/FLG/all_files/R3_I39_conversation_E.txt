[Tourist 39:] Hi, are there any good places to camp that are not too far from town but also close to a nice hiking trail?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
Canyon Vista Campground is a good choice on Lake Mary Rd.
[Tourist 39:] How is the trail?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] It is close to the campground and takes you through nice Ponderosa pine trees.
[Tourist 39:] ok thanks
