[Tourist 19:] Hi
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
[Tourist 19:] I want to see the volcanoes. What are the best spots?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Sunset Crater has a number of shorter relatively easy hikes that go through lava fields. I would grab the Area Monuments guide newspaper inside the visitor's center behind the desk.
[Tourist 19:] Can you walk to the top of the crater and look down into the inside?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] They do not have that since the cinders around it are incredibly loose. I would recommend Meteor Crater if you want to look into the inside of a large impact (although that was a huge meteor and not a volcano)
[Tourist 19:] gotcha
thanks
