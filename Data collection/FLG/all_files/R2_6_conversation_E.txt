[Tourist 6:] Hello, we we're wondering what are some notable buildings along route 66 to visit while going through the city?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] There is a self-guided Rte 66 tour that starts in the Historic Train Center on 1 E. Rte. 66. In the visitor's center, there is a self-guided map that shows the original alignment through the redeveloped Southside Historic District and passes by classic drive-in motels and Flagstaff landmarks of old. Let me know if you have further questions.
[Tourist 6:] We've read through one of the tours, we'll have to get our own and check it out. One thing that was mentioned was the underground tunnels dug by Chinese residents and later on the steam power plant, are there any areas to see these tunnels?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] There are not any areas that are open to the general public, but the Pioneer Museum has a map of the tunnels. You could ask individual business owners if you could see them.
[Tourist 6:] Thanks for the help!
