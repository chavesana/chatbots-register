[Tourist 18:] Hi
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
[Tourist 18:] How can I help/
[Tourist 18:] What activities are available at snowbowl now in the summer?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] They have a lot - the scenic chairlift, summer tubing, bungee trampoline, mini ropes course, treasure panning, barrel rolling. Very good activities for kids.
[Tourist 18:] Is there any age restrictions to the chairlift?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] They do it by height/weight but do not give specifics on the website. I would call (928) 779-1951.
[Tourist 18:] Thank you
