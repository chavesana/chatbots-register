[Tourist 9:] Hi
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. How can I help?
[Tourist 9:] Are there any vegetarian friendly restaurants in or near downtown?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Red Curry Kitchen is a good vegan restaurant, 10 N San Francisco St, as well as Whyld Ass Restaurant 121 E. Birch Ave (just east of San Francisco). A lot of restaurants offer vegetarian options, including the locally-made Tepa vegetarian burgers.
[Tourist 9:] Thank you!
Are there also any parks with playgrounds close by?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Thorpe Park is your closest option with playground equipment. Santa Fe Ave. & Thorpe Park Rd. going towards Lowell Observatory.
[Tourist 9:] Great! Thanks!
