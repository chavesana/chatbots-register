[Tourist 8:] Hi do you have any 2-days schedule to visit Flagstaff and the area?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
There is a 5-Day Explore Flagstaff guide available. If you want to pick up a physical copy, you can get one at the Flagstaff Visitor Center. You can also download a PDF version from the flagstaffarizona.org website. You just need to google "explore flagstaff itinerary planning guide" and it will pop up as one of the first options.
The guide gives highlights and the main attractions for the area.
