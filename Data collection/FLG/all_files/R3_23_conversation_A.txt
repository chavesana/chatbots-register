[Tourist 23:] Hi
I will stay for the week and it is my daughter's birthday on Friday. Where do I find the best birthday cake in town?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. I would recommend going in to talk to the bakers at Macy's European Coffee Shop downtown. They make delicious custom cakes.
They need a couple of days' lead time to be able to put custom orders on the schedule.
If that doesn't work, there are of course the bakeries in Fry's, Safeway, and so on, but I find local bakeries to be a bit better.
[Tourist 23:] Is it pricy?
Macy's
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] I can't remember offhand how much I paid for a half sheet cake last time I ordered. You can give them a call. Their number is (928) 774-2243
[Tourist 23:] Thank you
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You're very welcome!
