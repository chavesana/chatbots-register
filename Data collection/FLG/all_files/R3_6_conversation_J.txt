[Tourist 6:] Hi there
Is there any zoos around here?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] There are not any Zoos but Bearizona is a drive through north american wildlife park that is 30 miles west of here in Williams and Out of Africa is a African wildlife park about one hour south in Camp Verde.
[Tourist 6:] So, for the bearizona, do you know if it is safe to drive through with a rental car?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Yeah it is you just can't have anything out side of the car, if it makes you nervous you can take a bus ride trough instead.
[Tourist 6:] How much does it cost?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] $22 for Adults and $11 for Children
[Tourist 6:] Thank you for yyour help
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] you are welcome have a great day
