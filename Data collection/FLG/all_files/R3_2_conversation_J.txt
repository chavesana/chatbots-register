[Tourist 2:] Hi, is the antelope canyon ok for one that is slightly claustrophobic?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello
It would probably not be a good place to go for someone that is claustrophobic as the canyon walls are really narrow and you cannot leave on your own if you get uncomfortable you must stay with your guide.
[Tourist 2:] I see thanks
