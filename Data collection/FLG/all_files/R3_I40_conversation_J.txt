[Tourist 40:] Hi, how much walking is involved for visiting Walnut?
A companion has some limitations to walking long distances.
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] its tough to see walnut canyon with out hiking you can see some ruins from the Visitor Center and possibly could  do the one mile accessible rim trail but the island trail is 280 steps into the canyon to get close to the ruins.
