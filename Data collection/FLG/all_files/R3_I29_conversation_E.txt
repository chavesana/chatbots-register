[Tourist 29:] Hello
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
[Tourist 29:] Can I leave my car parked here at the Visitor Center to walk around?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You can on the Amtrak side of the Visitor's Center. It's $1 an hour to park. The kiosk to pay is near the green dumpster.
[Tourist 29:] So what places I should go in Flag?
