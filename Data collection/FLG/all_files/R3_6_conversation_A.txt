[Tourist 6:] Hi there
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. What can I help you with?
[Tourist 6:] What is parking like in downtown area?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Parking downtown is $1/hour for any city-run parking. There is also a company called American Valet that runs a number of the parking lots downtown, but they charge $2-3/hour. The Flagstaff Visitor Center has free 30 minute parking available 8-5pm, and it is free to park in that lot after hours.
[Tourist 6:] From the visitor center, is it interesting to walk around in this part of the city?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] definitely. The Visitor Center is in the center of downtown, and most everything downtown is locally owned and operated. Downtown has managed to keep much of its historic buildings intact.
[Tourist 6:] Thank you
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You're welcome.
