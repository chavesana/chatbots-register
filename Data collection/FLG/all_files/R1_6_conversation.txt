[Tourist:] Hi
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello there! My name is <Tour Guide>, how can I help you?
[Tourist:] I live in Flagstaff and my family is going to visit me and my husband. What i can do with them?
Could you give me some tips?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Absolutely! What kinds of things do they like to do, and what is the age range of the group?
[Tourist:] There are 4 adults 40 years old
My mother 65
And a 15 teenager
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Okay, so a pretty wide range. Do you think they would be interested in museums, outdoors, local attractions, etc?
[Tourist:] They don't hike, but i think that they would be willing to visit some places
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Would they be interested in a scenic drive? The loop road up at Sunset Crater and Wupatki national monuments would be a perfect place to visit to still take in the sights but without any hiking.
[Tourist:] No museums, unless it's a must see.
Outdoor and lical atractions definitely
Local
Scenic drive would be nice
Do you have any 10 day schedule to visit Flagstaff and the area?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Absolutely. That loop road would be perfect for them, and depending on when they visit you could also take them up to the Arizona Snowbowl for the scenic chairlift ride. It brings you up to about 11,500ft and you can see the Grand Canyon in the distance from the top. If they'd like a short walk around downtown, there is a historic walking tour brochure at the Flagstaff Visitor Center and it's an easy walk where you can also learn the history of the town and check out the local shops and galleries.
[Tourist:] Sounds interesting
[6:12pm] [Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] At the Flagstaff Visitor Center, we have a guide called Explore Flagstaff that gives a 5-day itinerary that you can easily expand into 10 days.
It is sectioned off into different areas, such as day trips, grand canyon, historic, and so on.
[Tourist:] Could you tell me more places that i can do in one day
Is there any link that gives me access?
To the information that you mentioned?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Sure! If you want a full day, I would say you can visit Walnut Canyon national monument - just 15 minutes east of town on I-40 - and go out to the Meteor Crater, then loop back to town for lunch and head up to the Sunset Crater and Wupatki ruins.
[Tourist:] Is there any cost for these places?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You can find information on all of the attractions I've listed at our website, www.flagstaffarizona.org, and then for any of the national monuments they also have their own websites. For the national parks, if you have a national parks pass it is free for everyone in the vehicle, otherwise it's $20/car at Sunset and Wupatki and $8/person at Walnut Canyon.
[Tourist:] They are coming in August. What about the local events? Concertsand Street events?
I meant concerts, sorry
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Not to worry, I understood! I'm looking at Flagstaff365.com, and I see that there are quite a few concert series going on in August.
<link>
Here is the link to my August search.
Flagstaff 365 is the events website for Flagstaff, and they update nearly every day with more events and activites
So even if there isn't something listed right now that would interest you or your family, there may be other events posted in a month or two for that timeframe.
You can also go to www.flaglive.com for more music-focused events.
[Tourist:] Oh, Sounds fun. Is this only local? Or I can find events and conserts from the area, like sedona, phoenix, and so forth.
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Flag Live does list events in Verde Valley, but otherwise these websites are Flagstaff-focused.
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] We don't have as much information for the Phoenix area, unfortunately. I do know that they have a downtown First Friday event, like we do here in Flagstaff, but also keep in mind that in August, Phoenix will be significantly hotter than here in Flagstaff. Where we'll be in the 80s, they can be in the 110-120 range.
[Tourist:] I see. Better not take my mother there. Lghs. Also, is that possible to make a list of the must see places  in Flagstaff and the region?
Regarding live music in town, what do you suggest? Rock for example.
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Absolutely! For the music, your best bet is to look at the Flag Live website. It will have the most up-to-date information available, and you can also look at the Oprheum's schedule at <link> to see if they have any rock bands coming in.
[Tourist:] Also, is there any night club in town? To go out for dance?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] For the highlights of Flagstaff, you can look at <link>
We don't really have any night clubs. The closest I can think of is Collins Irish Pub.
The Museum Club has line dancing, but that's completely different from a night club.
[Tourist:] Is orpheum is a bar with live music? Or a place for concerts?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] The Orpheum is a concert venue, but it also has a bar in it that is only open during performances.
[Tourist:] How museum is rated by the visitors? And how does the dacing works?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] The Museum Club isn't an actual museum - it's a country music venue and is original to Route 66. You can see their schedule on their website at <link>
They teach you how to dance, so even if you don't know how to line dance it's very easy to pick up!
[Tourist:] Hmm sounds interesting!
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Is there anything else I can help you with? If you're in town, you can also come by the Flagstaff Visitor Center to pick up maps and brochures about what we've discussed. We're in the train station in the Downtown area.
[Tourist:] I definitely will. I think that's all for now. Thanks a lot for your help.
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] I'm glad to help!
