[Tourist 1:] Hi
Is it possible to visit the original space where Casablanca was shot?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] I'm not sure if it is true or not but there is a rumor that there were scenes shot in the Hotel Monte Vista Lobby.
[Tourist 1:] okay
We're wondering what are some notable buildings along route 66 to visit while going through the city?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Notable Route 66 buildings would be the Grand Canyon Cafe, The Lumberjack Cafe (vacant) Miz Zips, The Museum Club, Galaxy and the El Pueblo Motel would be a few iconic places.
[Tourist 1:] Does the tourist center have a city map?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Yes there are complimentary Maps at the Visitor Center.
[Tourist 1:] Thank you
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] you are welcome
