[Tourist 2:] Hello. I have a question
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello there!
[Tourist 2:] Where's a place to watch world cup in downtown
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] There are a couple of sports bars and restaurants downtown. I'd recommend trying Majerle's on Route 66/San Francisco first, and then Charly's Pub & Grill, Collins Irish Pub, or The Market would also likely have the match on.(England scored already in the first 5 minutes!)
[Tourist 2:] Oh wow!! We need to get to that pub quickly then.
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] It'll definitely be an interesting game! Did you have any other questions?
[Tourist 2:] Yes, are there any thrift shops near here?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Yes, there's The Garden Thrift just south of the tracks on Beaver Street/Phoenix Ave.
There are other thrift stores in driving distance as well.
