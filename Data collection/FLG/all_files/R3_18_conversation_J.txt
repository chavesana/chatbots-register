[Tourist 18:] Hi
Is the Grand Canyon likely to be crowded tomorrow?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Yeah  but still well worth the trip if you go to the east rim or walk along the rim trails you can always find uncrowded places.
[Tourist 18:] thanks for the tips
Is it hot there?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] no it is about the same as here unless you hike into the Canyon
[Tourist 18:] Are we allowed to hike into the Canyon?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Yeah you can there are some suggested day hikes that you can do on either the Bright Angel Trail or the Hermit trail that are shown on the Hiking map that can be picked up at the Visitor Center.
[Tourist 18:] Cool
Thanks
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] you are welcome
