[Tourist 24:] Hi
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
[Tourist 24:] What activities I can do with my family in Flagstaff?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Does your family enjoy outdoor activities, such as hiking?
[Tourist 24:] They don't hike... but i think that they would be willing to visit some places
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] The Lowell Observatory has good exhibits for all ages. You can go to exhibits during the day and come back at night for the same price. On weekends, they also have music, family movies,  and children activities at Heritage Square starting at 4:30
[Tourist 24:] Do you know what time the observations start at night?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] When the sun goes down, they have astronomers manning the telescopes. They close at 10 pm.
[Tourist 24:] what about the exhibits, how long is the tour?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] The tours are usually an hour and they have several throughout the day and evening.
There is a brochure in the Visitor Center that gives a small sample of the daytime exhibits.
[Tourist 24:] sounds good. tks
