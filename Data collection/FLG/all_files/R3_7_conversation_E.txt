[Tourist 7:] What is the spot in the Grand Canyon that the river makes a turn, and everybody takes pictures there?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
A big U shaped turn?
[Tourist 7:] that's it
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] This?
<<picture>>
[Tourist 7:] Yes! I want to go there
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] That is Horseshoe Bend in Page, AZ. It's about 2 hours from Flagstaff on 89 N.
It's free if you have a National Parks Pass. There are signs from the road and it's a 0.75 mile hike to it.
[Tourist 7:] I don't have the pass
Do I have to book a ticket or anything?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] No. There is a $30 pass there at the Parking Lot. If you are considering going to any other parks, I would get the America the Beautiful Pass for $80 at any National Park or Monument.
[Tourist 7:] how does it work?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You could even go to Sunset Crater National Monument (19 miles outside of Flagstaff on 89, on the way) to obtain one at their visitor's center.
You would leave the Parks pass on your dashboard, so not to get a ticket at Horseshoe Bend.
[Tourist 7:] oh ok
thank you for the information
have a great day
