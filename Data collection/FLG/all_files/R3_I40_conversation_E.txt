[Tourist 40:] Hi
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
[Tourist 40:] Is it worth to visit Sedona?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] How can I help?
[Tourist 40:] Is it worth to visit Sedona?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] There are some very pretty red rocks there and has different scenery than Flagstaff. If you like hiking there are some good ones there, but also just nice to go to some viewpoints. The shopping area can be a bit too much in my opinion.
[Tourist 40:] What are the major viewpoints?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] If you head down 179 to the Red Rock Scenic Highway there are several viewpoints. Also Schnebly Hill has some good viewpoints and the Airport Rd. overlook
[Tourist 40:] Why the rocks are red?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Lots of iron in them.
[Tourist 40:] thank you
