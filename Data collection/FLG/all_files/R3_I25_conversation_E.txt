[Tourist 25:] Hello
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
How can I help?
[Tourist 25:] Where is the historic center of the city?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You are basically in the middle of it. On either side of the tracks is the Downtown Historic District and Southside Historic District.
The neighborhoods of Townsite and La Plaza Vieja are the original neighborhoods to the slight west.
[Tourist 25:] Is it interesting to walk around in this part of the city?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Yes. There are self-guided walking tours inside the visitor's center that gives history of buildings and a public art map as well.
[Tourist 25:] thank you
