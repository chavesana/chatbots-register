[Tourist 20:] Hi
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
How can I help?
[Tourist 20:] What is the best jeep tour of the vortex in Sedona? Do I need to book in advance?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] I've heard good things about the Pink Jeep tours, but they do not a specific Vortex package. Red Rock Western Jeep Tours is another option. You need to book a day or so in advance.
[Tourist 20:] Ok
what about grand canyon tours?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Grand Canyon Adventures has a good reputation.
[Tourist 20:] thank you
