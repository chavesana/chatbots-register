[Tourist 3:] We have 3 full days, first visit to Flagstaff we would like better to have more like an overview of different places.
Where we should go?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:]
Hello. Do you have 3 full days in Flagstaff, or will that also involve side trips to perhaps Sedona, Grand Canyon, etc.
[Tourist 3:] sorry, 3 days to do everything. if it s worth
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Museum of Northern Arizona, Lowell Observatory, and the 3 Area National Monuments are good to do around Flagstaff. We also have 50 miles of hiking trails if you want to be outside more.
I would also go to the Grand Canyon and make a trip to Sedona while you are in the area.
[Tourist 3:] how much time do I need for each?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] I would give yourself at least 2 hours at the Museum, go to Lowell for two hours and then come back in the evening for stargazing, and about 3 hours at Wupatki/Sunset Crater and 2 hours at Walnut Canyon.
If you like hiking, I would give yourself a full day at Grand Canyon  and at Sedona. If it's not, half a day for each.
That is a quicker pace suggestion; some people like to take more time.
[Tourist 3:] <<like>>
thank you for your help
