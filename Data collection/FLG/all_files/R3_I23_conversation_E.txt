[Tourist 23:] Hello, Me and my friends are looking for a place to have fun tonight, do you know we could go?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:]
How can I help?
[Tourist 23:] We are looking for a place to have fun tonight
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Tell me a little more about your interests. Do  you enjoy craft beer?
[Tourist 23:] Yes, we do!
I don't know the city, so any suggestions would help to decide
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] I would recommend getting the Ale Trail sheet from the Visitor's Center. It shows the 9 craft breweries, most in walking distance of downtown. If you get stamps from all (no purchase necessary) you get a free souvenir glass.
Also there is a musical performance starting at 6 pm at the Museum of Northern Arizona this evening.
[Tourist 23:] Do you know what kind of music?
The beer tour, is it safe places to walk around?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] I am not sure - it is a male and female performer, probably singer-songwriter combo. The downtown area is safe to walk around. Most breweries close on the earlier side anyway (before midnight)
[Tourist 23:] And if I decide to go to the museum, how far is it? is it in the route 66?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] It is about 2 miles from the Visitor's Center on Ft. Valley Rd. At Humphreys St., you will see signs to for the Museum of Northern Arizona
[Tourist 23:] Ok. I'll get the beer tour map. Thank you
