[Tourist 15:] What are the best toddler friendly things to do in Flagstaff?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
There is good playground equipment at Thorpe Park and Bushmaster Park. A short easy hike at Buffalo Park also has activity centers. There are kids activities at Heritage Square on Fridays and Saturdays starting at 4:30 (movies on Saturdays after the sun sets)
