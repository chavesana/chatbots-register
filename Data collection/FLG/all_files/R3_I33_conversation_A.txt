[Tourist 33:] Hi
Where is the best view spot of the Grand Canyon?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. The Grand Canyon has beautiful views everywhere in the park. Some of my favorite viewpoints are at the Desertview Watchtower on the East side of the canyon, and Mohave Point. There are shuttle buses that can take you to most of the viewpoints, or you are able to hike along the rim as well.
[Tourist 33:] Will it be crowded during the week?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] We're getting into the slower season, but "slow" for the Grand Canyon can still mean thousands of visitors in one day.
My best recommendation is to arrive early
[Tourist 33:] Ok
is it warmer there?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] The Grand Canyon is roughly the same elevation as we are here, and so it should be about the same temperature as Flagstaff.
[Tourist 33:] Ok. Thank you so much
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You're very welcome!
