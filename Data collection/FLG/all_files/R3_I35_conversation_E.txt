[Tourist 35:] Hi. I am afraid of heights . Should I go to Grand Canyon anyways?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
I went with a relative who is very afraid of heights (won't fly), and he did okay. There are some sections where the Canyon juts out further that might not be for you, but there are many viewing points with good railing (like Mather Point) that would make it well your while and you will feel safe enough.
[Tourist 35:] Do they have guard rails installed at view points?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] At many of them, they do. Some that also come to mind are Hopi Point and around the east side of Yavapai Geology Museum (you should go inside for an amazing window view too.)
[Tourist 35:] nice... thank you. I was afraid of not finding it enjoyable
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You should do okay and it's quite an experience.
[Tourist 35:] thanks
