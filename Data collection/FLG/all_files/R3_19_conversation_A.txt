[Tourist 19:] Hello
I was thinking about visiting the Arizona Museum. Is it worth?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. The Museum of Northern Arizona has won national awards and focuses on the history before Flagstaff was founded in the area, looking at native american and geologic history.
[Tourist 19:] How much does it cost?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Tickets are $12
[Tourist 19:] Do I have to book a ticket in advance or anything?
How much time would I spend there?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You don't need to book anything in advance, and I would plan for 2 hours at the museum.
[Tourist 19:] thanks
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] you're welcome!
