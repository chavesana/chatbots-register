[Tourist 15:] hi
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] How can I help you?
[Tourist 15:] I was thinking about visiting the Arizona Museum. Is it worth?
Is it far away from here?
Is it interesting to work around in this part of the city?
Is it worth to visit Sedona?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] The Museum of Northern Arizona is 3 miles north of of downtown it is definitely worth it they have great exhibits on the native cultures of our region as well as the geology and paleontology or our region.
Yes is is interesting and fun to work in this part of the city.
[Tourist 15:] 
Can I leave my car parked here at the Visitor Center to walk around?
Is the museum in this route 66?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Sedona is also worth a visit the re rocks in the are a are beautiful and the new age arts culture of Sedona a very unique.
You can leave you car parked on the east side of the Visitor Center for $1 per hour the west lot is only 15 minutes.
[Tourist 15:] 
Do you know the entrance cost for the museum?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] No the museum is on Highway 180, from the Visitor Center you will take a left on Route 66, a right on Humphreys street and when Humphreys ends at highway 180 make another left then watch for the signs.
The admission to the the museum is $12 of adults, $10 for seniors or military, and $8 for Children.
[Tourist 15:] thank you
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] you are welcome
