[Tourist 11:] Hello
Are dogs allowed at the Wupatki monument?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
They are not allowed on the trails. Most of the trails are short (0.25 miles or so) to the Native American dwellings. If there are two people, you could take turns.
[Tourist 11:] Was this a site where the Native Americans really lives?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] The Anasazi are reported to have lived there in the 1100 time period. They are not a tribe still in existence.
[Tourist 11:] Is there a camp ground there (or close)?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] There are a few Coconino National Forest campgrounds close in the area between Sunset Crater and Wupatki. Bonito Campground is one option, Daisy Springs another. They are more on the primitive side.
[Tourist 11:] Thanks
