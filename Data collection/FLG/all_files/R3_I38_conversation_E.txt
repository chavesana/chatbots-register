[Tourist 38:] hi
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
How can I help?
[Tourist 38:] I want to visit Antelope Canyon. If I drive into the area by myself, can I enter the canyon?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You must be accompanied by a guide. You can drive up and get on a tour at Lower Antelope Canyon. It's about $50. The Upper Antelope tours usually drive people to the location on Jeeps.
[Tourist 38:] What is the best, lower or upper canyon with kids (9 and 4)?
Can I do both at the same day?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You could, but it's not entirely necessary. Lower Canyon is $10 cheaper, but there are more stairs involved, which might be tough for the 4 year old. The back of the jeep tour to upper antelope might be fun for both of them.
[Tourist 38:] Thanks for your help
