[Tourist 5:] Hi, I would love suggestions on sightseeing and tours in and around the Flagstaff area
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. What kind of tours are you interested in doing?
[Tourist 5:] where we can see natural landmarks
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] There are a couple of options. Johnny Anaya is a local historian who does specialized tours for visitors.
You can also look at a couple of the tour companies in the area. Let me pull up their names.
[Tourist 5:] ok
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Okay, All Star Grand Canyon Tours and Grand Canyon Adventures are both tour companies that do tours of northern Arizona attractions.
They both have small vans, around 10 passengers maximum I believe.
[Tourist 5:] ok that works.
I will look at these. thanks
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You're very welcome.
