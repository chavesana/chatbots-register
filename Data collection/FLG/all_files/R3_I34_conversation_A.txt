[Tourist 34:] Hello, is it possible to do Sunset Crater, Wupaitiki and Dinosaur Tracks in 1 day?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. I believe doing all three of those in would day could be doable. Dinosaur Tracks is in Tuba City, so I would recommend starting there and making your way back down to Flagstaff as you visit each location.
[Tourist 34:] How much longer do you think each attraction would take?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] I recommend planning at least 1-2 hours at each location.
[Tourist 34:] Plus driving
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Okay in total, you're looking at about 3 hours of driving
Sunset and Wupatki are along the same loop road
[Tourist 34:] Oh ok! good
Thank you
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] you're welcome!
