[Tourist 1:] Hello
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. What can I help you with?
[Tourist 1:] What are the best restaurants in Flagstaff?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] What kind of restaurant are you looking for? (Italian, Indian, diner, BBQ etc) We have a wide variety of local restaurants to choose from.
[Tourist 1:] Maybe sandwiches
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Okay! Some really good sandwich places I've been to are Aspen Deli and Proper Meats and Provisions downtown, and there's also Crystal Creek Sandwich Company on Milton Rd.
[Tourist 1:] What makes them special? i'm in downtown
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Well all of them are locally owned, and Proper Meats sources their products from the region. They cost a little bit more ($12 for a sandwich vs. 6 or 7) but are well worth it.
Aspen Deli is a family-run business and their sandwiches are delicious.
[Tourist 1:] Thank you!
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You're very welcome!
