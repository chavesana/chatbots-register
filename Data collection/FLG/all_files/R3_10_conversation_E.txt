[Tourist 10:] Hi
I am a senior with disability for up-down steps, but Antelope Canyon has been on my bucket list.
Can I still access the canyon?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
Upper Antelope Canyon tours do not have steps. They do take you to the location on a Jeep Tour, but once you are there you can walk through with the guide without stairs. Lower Antelope does have stairs.
[Tourist 10:] How much for adults?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] They are typically about $60 for Upper Antelope. Inside the Visitor's Center they have a full listing of the Antelope Canyon tours behind the desk.
[Tourist 10:] Thank you
