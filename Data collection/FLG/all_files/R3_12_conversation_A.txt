[Tourist 12:] Hi
Are there any parks with playgrounds close by?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. Yes, the closest playground to downtown is located at Thorpe Park, just a few blocks away at the base of the road to Lowell Observatory.
They have free parking there, and brand-new play structures.
