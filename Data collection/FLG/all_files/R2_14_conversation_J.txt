[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] No there is not a AA office in Flagstaff the closest one is located in Prescott which is about an hour and a half away. If you are looking for maps or Arizona, Flagstaff or our surrounding states the Visitor Center can provide these to you for no charge.
[Tourist 14:] We are interested in a cabin in area, are there realty offices nearby.
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Remax has an office in the downtown are a they are located at the on North Humphreys street just before birch ave.
[Tourist 14:] we will need maps.   What is north of Flagstaff?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Inside the Visitor Center they can provide you with maps of the area, there is a street map of Flagstaff that will show the area north of town as well.
If you take highway 180 norther there are some neigborhoods that are a bit more rural near the San Francisco peaks if you take highway 89 north you will find more rural neighborhoods called doney park. this is where amny people with horses or other animal live.
