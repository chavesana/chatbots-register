[Tourist 10:] Hi
Do you have any 2-days schedule to visit Flagstaff and the area?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
What are your interests? Are there any items that you know you want to see?
[Tourist 10:] Outdoors, adventures
And "locals-like" activities
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] One day could be hiking the San Francisco peaks Humphreys is the highest point in Arizona and you can hike to the top or for a more mellow trail the Sunset Trail is nice too. Another day could be seeing our monuments Sunset Crater and Wuptaki are really neat to see.
