[Tourist 39:] Hi there
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. What can I help you with?
[Tourist 39:] I am afraid of heights. Should I go to Grand Canyon anyways?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You can still go to the Grand Canyon. I would recommend going to Mather Point to see how you do first. It is completely fenced in and safe, so you can see how comfortable you are at that viewpoint.
[Tourist 39:] Great
Thank you
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You're welcome!
