[Tourist 13:] What bring the most people to Flagstaff?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Flagstaff is a central hub for Northern Arizona, and many of our visitors stay here and do day trips outside of the Flagstaff area. For the city itself, there is the Route 66 history, Lowell Observatory (where they discovered Pluto), the museums and national monuments, as well as our year-round festivals.
