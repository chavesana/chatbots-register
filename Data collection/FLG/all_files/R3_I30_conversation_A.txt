[Tourist 30:] Where are the nearest used bookstores to the visitor center?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] There is a used bookstore downtown, just half a block from the Visitor Center. It is called Starrlight Books, and it is just north on Leroux Street. There is also a local independant bookstore called Brightside Book Shop on N San Francisco St.
