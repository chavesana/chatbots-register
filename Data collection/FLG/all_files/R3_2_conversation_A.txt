[Tourist 2:] hello, is the upper antelope canyon ok for one that is slightly claustrophobic?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. Antelope Canyon is a narrow slot canyon, so it isn't recommended for anyone with claustrophobia. A good alternative would be to do to Bryce Canyon in Utah, which has a similar feel without being so narrow, or the Sedona area. They both have beautiful red rock formations.
You may also want to try Lower Antelope Canyon. It isn't as narrow as the upper canyon, and you can see if that part of the canyon would be okay with claustrophobia.
[Tourist 2:] Ok. thanks
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Not a problem. Can I help you with anything else?
[Tourist 2:] How far the Utah canyon from here?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] It's a 4.5 hour drive from Flagstaff, but only 2 hours from Page. Sedona is 45 minutes south of Flagstaff.
[Tourist 2:] right, that's all then. thanks
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] ok, you're welcome!
