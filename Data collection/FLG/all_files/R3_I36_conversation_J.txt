[Tourist 36:] Hi
We have three full days, for a first visit to Flagstaff we would like better to have more like an overview of different places.
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] The first day i would visit The historic downtown to get a feel for the town. Then we have some great monuments Walnut Canyon Sunset Crater and Wuptkai. Great hiking trails from Arizona Snowbowl and near Mount Elden. I would do these outdoor activities in the mornings then in the afternoon when it's raining you can visit Museum of Northern Arizona, Riordan Mansion, and Pioneer Museum.
[Tourist 36:] How much time do I need for each attraction?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] i would give a couple hours to each
[Tourist 36:] Thanks
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] you are welcome
