[Tourist 14:] Hi, my family and I like adventure sports. Is there any site in Flagstaff for this?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. What kind of adventure sports are you interested in? There is the Flagstaff Extreme Adventure Course just south of town at Fort Tuthill. There are two different courses available, one that is purely ziplining and another that envolves a lot of climbing and obstacles through the trees as well as some ziplines.
[Tourist 14:] That sounds fun
My son is 14 years old, do you think he can do the course?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] It's a lot of fun. 14 is old enough for the adult course, though they do have a height restriction. Let me check that.
[Tourist 14:] Ok
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Okay, I found it. "they must be able to reach the middle of their palms to a height of 5’11″ (180 cm) while keeping their feet flat on the ground. "
They have this requirement because some of the ropes to grab onto are tall, but I think most kids are able to reach that with their hands.
[Tourist 14:] Oh, I think he will be fine. He is quite tall
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Yup
[Tourist 14:] thank you so much
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You're welcome, have fun!
