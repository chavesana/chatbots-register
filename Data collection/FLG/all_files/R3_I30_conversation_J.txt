[Tourist 30:] Hi
Should I go to the Grand Canyon or Sedona?
What is my best choice?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] If you have never been to either I would go to Grand Canyon
[Tourist 30:] Where is the best view spot of the Grand Canyon?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] That would really be an opinion everyone has their favorite. I would say the most iconic view is Mather point or the views from the historic village.
[Tourist 30:] Right
thanks
