[Tourist 22:] Hi
What places are open late?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
For food or tourist-type attractions?
[Tourist 22:] tourist type
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Most close at 5pm, but Lowell Observatory is open until 10 pm. Sunset Crater and Wupatki can also be driven through after 5 pm, although their visitor center's are closed.
[Tourist 22:] Is it cloudy.. still worth to go to the observatory?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] I think it will be. It might clear up by evening and you can go back for the same price.
[Tourist 22:] thank you
