[Tourist 26:] Are there tours from Flagstaff to the Antelope Canyon?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Grand Canyon Adventures has one. <<link>>
[Tourist 26:] Do you know what the tour includes?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] 1.5 hour tour of Antelope Canyon, lunch at Lake Powell, going to Horseshoe Bend and Transportation from your hotel and back.
[Tourist 26:] Is there a lot of hiking in this tour?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Not too much. Horseshoe Bend is 1.5 miles roundtrip. Antelope Canyon isn't a lot of walking, since they want to give plenty of time for photographs.
[Tourist 26:] Thank you
