[Tourist 32:] hi
What time is the best time of the day to visit the Antelope Canyon?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. Midday is the best time of day to visit Antelope Canyon, because that is when the light shines down directly (like you see in many photos from the Canyon). You'll need to book a tour for Upper Antelope Canyon, and the Flagstaff Visitor Center has a list of tour company options that they can provide you.
The one I know off the top of my head is Chief Tsosie's tours.
[Tourist 32:] I am a senior with disability for up-down steps. Do you think I can still access the canyon?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Ahh that will be difficult. Upper Antelope Canyon has a number of ladders as part of the trail. You can look into Lower Antelope Canyon as an alternative. It isn't as narrow as the Upper canyon, and has fewer restrictions on visitation.
[Tourist 32:] I see. Thank you for your help
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You're welcome, have a good day!
