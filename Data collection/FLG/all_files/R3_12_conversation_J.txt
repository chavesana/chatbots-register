[Tourist 12:] Hi there
We like adventure sports. Is there any site in Flagstaff for this?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Flagstaff Extreme Adventure Course would be a good option or there are some rock climbing area such as the pit and and priest draw or many mountain biking trail such as Shultz creek or the upper and lower Oldham trails.
[Tourist 12:] For the Adventure Course, are kids allowed?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Yeah there is a kids course for smaller kids or they must be able to reach the middle of their palms to a height of 5’11″ (180 cm) while keeping their feet flat on the ground to do the adult course.
[Tourist 12:] thanks
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] you are welcome
