[Tourist 15:] Hi
What time is the best time of the day to visit the Antelope Canyon?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] The best time is the closest you can to midday to get the shafts of light however this is a difficult time of year to visit as it is too dangerous to give tours when there is rain nearby.
[Tourist 15:] thank you
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] you are welcome
