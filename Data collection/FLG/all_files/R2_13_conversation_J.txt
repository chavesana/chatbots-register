[Tourist 13:] Hi. I have 1 hour only. What should I do?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] If you only have one hour in Flagstaff I would explore the historic downtown area  there are many shops, local restaurants and art galleries in the area and this will give you a good feel for the community.
[Tourist 13:] Anything I must see there?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] A couple highlights are the historic two spot train, the Hotel Monte Vista, The Weatherford Hotel and the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church.
[Tourist 13:] thank you
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] you are welcome
