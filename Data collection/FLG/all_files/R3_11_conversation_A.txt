[Tourist 11:] Hi
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. what can I help you with?
[Tourist 11:] Should I go to the Grand Canyon or Sedona? What is my best choice?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] It really depends on what you're interested in because they are very different locations. Did you want to hike, whichever one you go to?
or more sightsee?
[Tourist 11:] Sightsee
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Okay. Do you have a National Parks pass? (This will help with my recommendation)
[Tourist 11:] Yes we do
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Okay perfect! In that case, I would definitely recommend going to the Grand Canyon. It is included in your national park pass, and you can easily spend a full day there. Once you park, you can take the free shuttle buses around the canyon and are able to access most of the park that way.
The only exception is the Desert View Watchtower, which I highly recommend.
[Tourist 11:] Thank you
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You're welcome!
