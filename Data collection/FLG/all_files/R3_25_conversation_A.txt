[Tourist 25:] Hello
Is walnut canyon handicap accessible?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. Not all of Walnut Canyon is handicap accessible. The Rim Trail is, however, and you are able to see most of the canyon that way. The Visitor Center also has a beautiful viewpoint and benches for looking out at the canyon.
[Tourist 25:] What time does it open in the morning?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] It is open starting at 9am.
[Tourist 25:] thank you
