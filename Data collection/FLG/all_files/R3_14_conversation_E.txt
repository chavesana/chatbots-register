[Tourist 14:] Hi
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
How can I help?
[Tourist 14:] what is the major attraction that bring the most people to Flagstaff?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Lowell Observatory is very popular, as are the three national monuments in the area (Walnut Canyon, Sunset Crater, and Wupatki).
The Museum of Northern Arizona is well known for its Native American cultural artifacts.
[Tourist 14:] Which national monument is the closest?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Walnut Canyon is the next exit outside of town on 40 East. Maybe 15 minutes. Sunset Crater is 19 miles outside of town on 89 N.
[Tourist 14:] how many miles is the hike in the Walnut?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] There are a few rim trails around the monument. I would ask for the Area Monuments newspaper behind the desk at the Visitor's Center for more specifics.
[Tourist 14:] Do they have RV parking there?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] I cannot confirm that information on their website, but typically most Monuments have a few RV parking spaces.
[Tourist 14:] good enough, i ask there. Thank you
