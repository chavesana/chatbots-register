[Tourist 12:] Hi, how much does it cost the tour at the Lowell Observatory?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
Lowell is $15, but you can also return at night to do stargazing with telescopes for same one day admission. There are $2 off coupons inside the visitor's center behind the desk.
[Tourist 12:] sounds good
