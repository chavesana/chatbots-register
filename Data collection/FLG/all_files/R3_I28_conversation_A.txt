[Tourist 28:] hello
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. what can I help you with today?
[Tourist 28:] What is Flagstaff known for?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Historically, Flagstaff is known for Route 66 and its location close to the Grand Canyon. Lowell Observatory is also located here, which is where Pluto was discovered.
[Tourist 28:] Is the observatory worth the visit? what time does the observation start?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] The observatory is well worth a visit. They are open from 10am-10pm Monday-Saturday, 10am-5pm Sunday. There are solar viewings and tours during the day, and once the sun sets they begin nighttime observations.
I would recommend wearing warm clothing, because you will be outside for the nighttime viewing.
[Tourist 28:] Thanks for the tip
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Of course! Do you have any other questions?
