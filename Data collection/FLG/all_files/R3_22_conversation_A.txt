[Tourist 22:] Hi
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. How can I help you?
[Tourist 22:] Is there a RV parking area in the Wupatki?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] There is limited parking, but they do have a parking lot that can accommodate RVs.
[Tourist 22:] Is the parking free?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] This time of year, you shouldn't have any trouble finding RV parking. Parking is free, but it is a national monument so they have a park entrance fee. Do you have a national parks pass?
[Tourist 22:] We do
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Perfect! That will cover everyone in the vehicle, so you don't have to pay the entrance fee.
[Tourist 22:] Awsome
Thanks
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You're welcome
