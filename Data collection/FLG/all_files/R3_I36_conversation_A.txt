[Tourist 36:] Hi
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. What can I help you with today?
[Tourist 36:] Can you suggest good breweries to visit?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Absolutely! We have quite a few local breweries in Flagstaff. Is there a particular kind of beer you like?
And do you want to do a brewery tour? A couple offer tours of their facilities.
[Tourist 36:] I like to try. Not a specific type of beer. Tours would be nice
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Okay! Well if you want to try something eclectic, a really good option is Dark Sky Brewery downtown. They brew about 100 flavors a year.
For more traditional beers, Lumberyard and Mother Road would be good options.
[Tourist 36:] All of them do tours? Do I have to make a reservation for a tour?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] I would recommend giving them a call to see. It depends on if they have someone available. I just did a tour of Mother Road's new brewery facilities last week, and it was fascinating because they have grown significantly since they moved their brewing to the second location on Butler Ave.
If you stop by the Visitor Center, there is a Brewery Trail passport that you can pick up and if you visit all the breweries on the list, there is a free beer glass.
[Tourist 36:] Do I need to do all on the same day?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Not at all, you can spread them out and you're not required to make a purchase at each location. There are 4 or 5 just in the downtown area alone.
[Tourist 36:] Sweet
Thank you so much
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You're welcome! Enjoy the breweries.
[Tourist 36:] I sure will $emoji
