[Tourist 8:] Hi!
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. How can I help you?
[Tourist 8:] Can you advise on a nearby camping ground. Dog friendly and with drinking water. Tents only. Thanks
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Many of the tent-only campgrounds just opened today in the Coconino National Forest (closest).  Not all of them are opened just yet. Give Coconino National Forest a call at (928) 527-3600 to ask which campgrounds and if pets are allowed. Private campgrounds in the Flagstaff area will have a mix of RV and tent sites. Hope that helps.
