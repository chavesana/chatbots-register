[Tourist 31:] Hello
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello. What can I help you with today?
[Tourist 31:] what are the major tourist attractions?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] What are you interested in? History, museums, outdoors, shopping, monuments, etc?
[Tourist 31:] Museums and monuments are both interesting
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] There are two museums north on 180 from downtown, the Pioneer Museum, which is about the founding of Flagstaff, and the Museum of Northern Arizona, which focuses on native american and geologic history.
We also have three national monuments in the area. Walnut Canyon is 15 minutes east on 40, Sunset Crater volcano is 30 minutes north on 89, and the Wupatki pueblo ruins are just another 15-20 minutes after the volcano.
[Tourist 31:] I heard about Wupatki. Is it a site where the Native Americans really lived?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Yes, they did! There are a few ruins there, and the largest one had about 100 rooms.
Researchers think that it was used as a major trading hub, because there are artifacts that were found there from peoples far south of us in Mexico.
[Tourist 31:] Cool
How much walking involved?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] The main ruin does require a bit of walking, but if walking is an issue there are also lookout points where you can sit on a bench and see the ruins. The trail makes a loop around the main ruin, and it is paved and an easy grade.
[Tourist 31:] Ok, thanks
