[Tourist 33:] hi
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Hello.
How can I help/
[Tourist 33:] Where is the best restaurant downtown?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Tell me a little about your food preferences? Fancy burgers? Mexican? Thai?
[Tourist 33:] let's say asian
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] I would say Karma Sushi across the street. Pato Thai on San Francisco is another good option.
[Tourist 33:] and are there any thrift shops near here?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] There is the Garden Thrift store on the other side of the railroad tracks on Beaver Street.
