[Tourist 20:] hi
should I go to the grand canyon if it is likely to rain?
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] Yeah It is still worth a visit typically it doesn't rain all day it will just be on and off, When the clouds are in the sky after a thunderstorm they make the best sunsets if yo are able to stay at the Grand Canyon until Sunset.
[Tourist 20:] Oh, I see. thank you
[Tech for Tourism - Research Page:] You are welcome
