[G:] Good morning, sir. What can I do for you? 
Some friends of mine are going to visit me this evening. Would you please buy some fruit for me? 
Yes, sir. Do you need some flowers? 
That's a good idea. Can you help me to get some? 
Certainly, sir. What kind of flowers would you like? 
A basket of lilies. 
You need fruit and lilies. Am I right? 
Right. Here is five hundred yuan in advance. Is it enough? 
I think it's quite enough. I'II have them bought for you as soon as possible. 
Great! Thank you very much.
