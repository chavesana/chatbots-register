[T:] Hi. I can't get going on my computer until I get a broadband hookup. 
Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and you'll be off and running. 
That would be okay if I had an Ethernet port. Unfortunately, my laptop uses wireless only. 
In that case, let me tell you about some alternatives. 
Anything to get me up and running. 
For starters, we have a computer lab. 
Fantastic! What do I have to pay per hour? 
The lab is completely free. But you do have to pay a dime a page for printing. 
That's fine. Now tell me about the other alternatives. 
Just bring your laptop down here to the lobby. We're set up for wireless right here. 
Great! I like that suggestion, but what if I need to print something there? 
Unfortunately, you'll have to go to the computer lab for your printing needs.
