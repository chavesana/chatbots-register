[T:] Well, we didn't ask for this room service.It must be somebody else's, I'm sure. 
Oh, is it? Let me check. 
Yes, please. 
I'm sorry to say that this room service charge is yours. 
We paid for the room service already in our room. 
Do you have any evidence? 
No, we got no receipt, but we paid on the spot.
