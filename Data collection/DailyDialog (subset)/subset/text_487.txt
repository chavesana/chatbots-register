[G:] Good afternoon, sir, is there anything I can do for you? 
Yes. I can't find my sweater. I have my laundry sent to you yesterday but when the washing is done. I find my swatter missing. 
Well, it's our fault.We are sorry for that.Would you please fill out the form? We will pay for you. 
That's fine. Maybe you should be more careful.
