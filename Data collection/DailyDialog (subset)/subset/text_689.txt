[G:] Good morning, Passport, please. 
Here you are. 
Ah, thank you.Please bring your luggage here for inspection. 
Ok.But is there anything wrong? 
It's just a regular inspection. Do you have anything to declare? 
I've got 6 packets of cigarettes and 2 bottles of champagne.Besides, I have two cameras, one is for my own use, and the other is a gift. 
Well, the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the duty-free allowance. But according to our law, each passenger is allowed only one camera duty-free.You ' ll have to pay duty for the other one. 
Ok. Where shall I pay duty for it? 
Please wait a minute. I'll make out the duty memo... Here you are.Take this and pay to the woman over there. 
I've paid for it. Here's the receipt. 
Very well. I hope you ' ll enjoy your stay in America. 
Thank you.
