[T:] There's a major problem with room 507. 
I'm sorry to hear that. Please tell me the exact problem. 
This room is overrun with cockroaches. 
There has been an occasional silverfish in the hotel, sir. 
I stopped counting at nine. 
Sir, this hotel just passed a thorough insect inspection with flying colors. 
Your inspector needs spectacles. The fact is that cockroaches are running rampant. 
I apologize, sir. Just a second, while I transfer you to my supervisor.
