[G:] Welcome, sir. May I help you? 
Yes, I wanna go to America for my vacation. 
No problem. Actually, we have some great packages. The most exciting season of Hawaii is now. How about a relaxing vacation in Hawaii? 
Sounds good. Are there any group tours I can go with? 
Yes. There will be one at the end of this month. For many people, a Hawaiian vacation promises languid days filled with sunbathing and poolside cocktails. For others, it ’ s all about non-stop action in one of the world's most extreme natural playgrounds. Whether you are in search of quiet relaxation or unbridled stimulation, Hawaii gives you the best of both. 
Great. So how long is the trip? 
15 days. The transportation by air will take five days. 
Fine. I happen to have 20 days for holiday, so exciting! How many places will be visited and what are they? Where will be staying and how about the food there? 
Sir, let's do it step by step. First, we will visit over 25 different places. Most of the places are in Hawaii ’ s Big Island. We will stay in Arlott ’ s Lodge 
Well, cool. What's the price for this trip? 
Well, right now there's a special rate for 40,000 RIB for this package, including everything such as airline ticket, tour guides, hotels and food. All you have to do is to sign up and we will take care of everything. 
Well. 40,000 RIB that's really a lot of money. I will have to think about it. 
Sure. By the way, this special price is only good through the end of the week. 
Is it Thursday? I mean if I let the chance slide... 
Yes, sir. It will be a great pity! 
Well. Ok, I will take it. 
Thank you!
