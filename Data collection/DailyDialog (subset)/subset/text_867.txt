[T:] Would you find any other available flight to Tokyo? 
Sure. We try our best. 
Thank you. 
Mr.Chen, are you sure you're taking BA - 007 back to Tokyo? 
Yes, of course. I think our travel agent would have made the reservation for us. 
I'm afraid this flight is all booked up. 
Are you sure? We can't really take it? I reconfirmed with Miss Peterson the other day. 
I'm afraid so except we have many no-show passengers.
