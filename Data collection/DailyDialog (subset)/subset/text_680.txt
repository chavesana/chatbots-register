[G:] Hello. This is the front desk. What can I do for you? 
Hi. I ’ m calling from Room 209. I couldn ’ t find the TV Guide. Can you send me one, please? 
Sure. Anything else? 
Yes. There is one more thing. 
Go ahead, please. 
The mini bar door was open when I checked in. I didn ’ t use it. Could you send someone to check it out? 
We ’ ll send someone right up. But don ’ t worry about that. Maybe the service person forgot to do it. 
Thanks.
