[G:] Good morning, sir. What can I do for you? 
I'm Jack in Room 606. Can you change the room for me? It's too noisy. My friend was woken up several times by the noise from upstairs. He said it was too much for him. 
I'm awfully sorry, sir. I do apologize. A ten-year-old boy and a mother live upstairs. Maybe the boy is a little bit naughty. 
Anyway, I'd like to change our room. 
No problem, sir. We'll manage it.
