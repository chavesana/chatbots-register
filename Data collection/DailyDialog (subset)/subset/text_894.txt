[T:] Hi. I need a wake-up call tomorrow. 
What time would you like your wake-up call? 
I need two calls, one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen. 
That is no problem at all, of course. You'll get a call at 7 o'colock and another at 7 fifteen. 
Then again, I think 7 fifteen is too early. Change 7 fifteen to 7 thirty, please. 
So, that'll be a call at 7 and another at 7 thirty.Do you have any other requests? 
Not just now, but if I do think of something later, I'll give you a ring. 
Okay, sir. Sleep well.
