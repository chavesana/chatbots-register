[T:] My wife and I are thinking about taking our parents with us on a vacation. Do you have any suggestion about where to go? 
The choice of destination is very important. It will too energetic for the old people if you make an excursion or go to climb mountains. But they'll be interested in going to the historical places of interest where they can have fun. 
Sometimes what young people like is different from the old. Maybe we can go visit first and then do some shopping. 
That's a good idea. That will allow both you and your parents to enjoy yourselves. 
What should we bring besides a change of clothes, money and some snacks? 
It's some medicine the doctor recommends. If you leave it at home, you will find it difficult to face up when the old people suffered a seizure. 
Oh, yes! I didn't think about that.Thank you for reminding me. How many days should we spend on a vacation? 
You'd better have all a light schedule. You can rest up for a few days if your parents find tired ã€‚ 
It seems that good planning for a family vacation is important to make sure everyone will be happy. 
Yes, that's right. Having an enjoyable time together is the goal.
