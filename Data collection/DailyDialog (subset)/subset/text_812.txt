[G:] Will you tell me the situation? 
I was in my friend's room talking for an hour of so. 
And then? 
I came back to my room and found that my suitcase was open and my camera and five hundred dollars in cash inside the wallet were gone. 
I'm afraid you must give up the cash.Are you insured? 
Yes, this is my overseas travel accident insurance card. 
I'll make a report for you and please claim this to the insurance company with this report.
