[G:] Good afternoon, sir. 
Good afternoon. I have a reservation under the name of Hilton. 
Could you spell that, please? 
Sure. It's H-I-L-T-O-N. 
One moment, please. Ah yes, Mr. Hilton, you booked a single room for three nights. Is that correct? 
Yes, that's right. 
I see from the computer that you are a frequent guest here. Do you have your loyalty card? 
Yes, here you are. And here's my credit card, too. 
Thank you. Right, your room number is 105. Here's your key and receipt. Thank you for choosing our hotel again, sir. 
Thank you, goodbye. 
Goodbye.
