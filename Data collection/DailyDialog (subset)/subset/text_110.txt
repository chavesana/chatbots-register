[G:] Good morning. Can I help you? 
I want an American breakfast with fried eggs, sunny side up. 
What kind of juice do you prefer, sir? 
Grapefruit juice and please make my coffee very strong. 
Yes, sir. American breakfast with fried eggs, sunny side up, grapefruit juice and a black coffee. Am I correct, sir? 
Yes, that's right. 
Is there any thing else, sir? 
No, that's all. 
Good morning, sir. I've brought the breakfast you ordered. 
Just put it on the table, please. 
Do you need anything else, sir? 
No, thanks. Ah, yes! Can I have some more juice for the minibar? 
What kind of juice would you like, sir? 
Tomato, orange and apple juice, please.
