[T:] There's a big problem with my room. I'm in 507. 
Would you tell me the nature of the problem, sir? 
I have cockroaches crawling in my room. 
Perhaps you saw a silverfish, sir. 
I've seen nine more cockroaches than I wanted to see. 
Sir, you haven't been drinking by any chance, have you? 
How dare you question my statement! 
Forgive me. You're 100 percent correct. Allow me to transfer you to my supervisor.
