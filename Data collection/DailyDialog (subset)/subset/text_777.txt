[G:] Some places aren't good to go.But I can show you the right bus to take. It will be no problem. 
We want to see the Statue of Liberty too. 
I have never done that myself. But I hear it is very interesting. You two should go. 
You have never gone to the Statue of Liberty?! I can't believe it! But you live here! 
Yes, but I'm very busy with work.And you know how it is, sometimes people don't visit the tourist sites in their own country. 
I know. Are the subway trains easy to take here?
