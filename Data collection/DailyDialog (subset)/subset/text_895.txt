[T:] Hi. Can you give me a wake-up call tomorrow? 
Certainly. What time would you like us to call you? 
I need two wake-up calls, if you don't mind, one at 7 and the other at 7 fifteen. 
Not a problem. We'll call you tomorrow morning at 7, and again at 7 fifteen. 
On second thought, you'd better make that second call at 7 thirty instead of 7 fifteen. 
Said, and done. Will there be anything else? 
No, that gets it for now, thank you. 
Well, give us a call if there's anything more we can help you with.
