[T:] You are from the travel agency, aren't you? 
[G:] Yes, are you Mr James? 
[T:] Yes, I am. Are you Miss Li from the travel agency? 
[G:] That's right. 
[T:] Do you mind telling me your name? 
[G:] Of course not. My name is Li Ping. Is this all your baggage? 
[T:] Yes, it is. I usually travel light. 
[G:] Welcome to Hong Kong. I'll go and get the car. Could you please wait a few minutes? 
[T:] Sure, and I'm glad to meet you. Thanks for your help.
