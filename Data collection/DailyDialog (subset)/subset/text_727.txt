[T:] Yes, I need more amenities. 
By amenities, exactly what do you mean, please? 
You know, the things that are free, like the soap and the shampoo. 
Okay, I got it. You've already run out of all your amenities? 
No, I still have plenty left, even if I took three baths a day. 
I'm more confused now than before. How is there a problem? 
I need to take home some souvenirs! 
Okay, finally I understand. You would like souvenirs! 
Yes, souvenirs that I can take home and add to my collection. 
If it's souvenirs you want, sir, just visit our souvenir shop. It has everything. 
Are you kidding? Whoever heard of paying for hotel souvenirs? 
No problem at all, sir. Housekeeping will deliver you all the amenities you like in a bit.
