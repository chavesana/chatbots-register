[T:] I have a reservation for a single with a bath. 
We're sorry, but single rooms have been occupied. 
What's the room rate? It's little expensive for me.Do you have any other room? 
Then, how about this room with just a shower? 
May I see the room? I'll take this room. Is the rate for a room only? 
No, sir.The tax is included.
