[T:] Could you please reserve a taxi for me? 
Do you think a private vehicle might be more to your liking? 
A private vehicle? No, thanks, I won't need one. 
Even better than a private vehicle is a limo. How does that sound? 
T A X I, please. 
A taxi it is. Where will you be headed? 
Rockefeller Center. Can you get the taxi here immediately, please? 
A taxi will be here in just a minute, sir. 
Good. I'll get my coat and come downstairs. 
The taxi will be ready when you are, sir.
