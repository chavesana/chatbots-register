[T:] Hi, I'd like a single room. 
Do you have a reservation? 
No, I ’ m afraid not. 
Let me check if we have any vacancies... You ’ re in luck.We have one single room available. 
How much is it? 
$60 a night.No charge for local calls on the phone or for the TV, unless you decide to watch the pay-per-view channels. 
Okay, I ’ ll take it. 
Here ’ s your key.Check out time is 12 noon.If you want to stay until 6 p.m., it ’ s another half day.After that you have to pay for another night. 
Okay.When is your restaurant open? 
It ’ s open from 6:30 a.m.to 10 p.m.every day. 
Okay, thank you.Which way to the room? 
It ’ s that way, on the second floor. 
Thanks.
