[G:] Excuse me.In this museum, you are not supposed to take pictures. 
Is that right? I didn't know it. 
Will you give me your camera? We have to confiscate your film. 
Will you forgive me? Could you return my camera? 
We keep it and return it later. 
Oh, I see.Then can I buy slides and picture postcards somewhere? 
You can buy them at a souvenir shop near the exit.
