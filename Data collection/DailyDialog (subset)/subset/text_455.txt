[G:] Good morning. Can I help you? 
Good morning. I'd like to make a reservation to Guangzhou for August 2. 
Just a moment, please. I'm sorry, sir. There is no ticket available on that day. But we have flights for Guangzhou the next day. 
May I inquire about the departure time? 
A 9:12 flight in the morning and a 14:00 flight in the afternoon. 
When will the plane reach for the morning flight? 
At 13:15. 
OK. I'd like to book a ticket for this one. 
All right, sir. Please reconfirm your ticket no later than 12 o'clock two days before the flight ; otherwise, your reservation will automatically be cancelled.
