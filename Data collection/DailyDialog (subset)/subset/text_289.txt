[T:] Excuse me. Can I change my seat with you? I want to sit beside my friend. 
Where is your seat? 
It's 9 - A in the middle part, a window seat too. 
OK, you mean the vacant one on the left? 
Yes, it is. Thank you very much. Let me help you to carry your baggage there. 
No need. I have only this small handbag with me. 
Thanks. Have a nice trip.
