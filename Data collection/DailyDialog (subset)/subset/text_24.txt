[T:] I'd like to have a couple of complete sets of paper money and coins. 
Yeah. You can take them home and either use them as a gift or keep them as mementoes. 
Ah, where can I find old paper money and coins used before and after 1949? 
I'd suggest that you go to the Philately Store in Nanjing Road East, where the items are authentic and the prices are reasonable. 
Good. Sorry to have troubled you so much, Miss. 
You're always welcome. Anything else can I do for you, sir? 
No, thanks. I did not notice it has been dark outside. I think it is time to dinner. 
I guess it is. The restaurant is on the second floor. Please enjoy your dinner, sir!
