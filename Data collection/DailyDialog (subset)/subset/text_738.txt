[T:] This visit is over for me. Here's your room key. 
Thank you for that, and in return, here's your receipt. 
And thanks to you. 
I hope you'll visit us again, sir. 
I'd be willing to try this hotel again, if you can promise me no more cockroaches. 
I guarantee you that our little "friends" won't be back. I hope your trip home is pleasant.
