[G:] Good evening. 
Good evening. Could you let us have a double room? 
How long will you be staying? 
A week or ten days. We'd like to have a quiet room, if possible-not too near the street. 
Let me see. Yes, you can have Room 313. It's at the back. 
What's the price per day '? And are the meals included or extra? 
20 pounds per day, including breakfast. 
All right, we'll take it. 
Very good, sir. Will you register, please? 
OK. 
Thank you. The porter will show you to your room
