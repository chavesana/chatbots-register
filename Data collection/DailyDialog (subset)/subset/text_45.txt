[G:] Can I help you, sir? 
[T:] Yes, please. I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife. 
[G:] What kind of presents do you want? 
[T:] Actually, I don't know exactly. Do you have anything recommended? 
[G:] OK. How about some very cool sneakers for your children? Anyway, it won't cost you much. It's only around $59.95 for each pair. It might be cheaper than that in America. 
[T:] Hey, How did you know I came from America? 
[G:] Just a hunch, sir. 
[T:] How much again? 
[G:] $59.95. 
[T:] That's really cheap for shoes like those. OK, I'll take 5 pairs. 
[G:] Sorry, sir. 
[T:] Why not? 
[G:] Because in this duty-free shop, your total expenditure cannot be over $300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife. 
[T:] Oh, my God. I've totally forgotten about that. Anyway, I think she would like a bottle of perfume. 
[G:] That's good. And I can also recommend you a good one. It's the brand of DENY. 
[T:] DENY? That's very expensive in America. It costs nearly $70 for only 50ml. 
[G:] It's $60 here. 
[T:] That's very unbelievable. Is it fake? 
[G:] Of course not, sir. 
[T:] OK, I'll take one.
