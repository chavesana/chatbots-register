[T:] I'm in 507, and I have a big problem. 
I'm so sorry. Kindly tell me what the problem is, sir. 
Everywhere I look, I see cockroaches. 
Perhaps you could look again, sir, to double-check. 
The next cockroach I see will be number ten. 
Mr. Sandals, I've worked here five years without seeing one cockroach. 
I've already suffered enough without listening anymore to you! 
You're right, sir. Please let me transfer you to my supervisor
