[T:] What a charming room! It faces south, and there's such a lovely view of the city. 
I'm glad you like it. The bell is on the bedside. Just ring if you want anything. The room attendant speaks a little English. So I don't think you'll have any trouble. 
No, I shouldn't think so. By the way, is there a socket for my razor? 
I think so. Here it is. It's by the basin. 
Is it a two-pin socket? 
Yes, it is. 
Good, I ' Ve get a two-pin plug.
