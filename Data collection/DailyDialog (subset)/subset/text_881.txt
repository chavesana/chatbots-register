[T:] My minibar is completely empty. 
Everything in that minibar has been consumed, sir? 
Everything's gone. 
Is there anything special you'd like? 
Just bring me three bottles each of Jim Beam and Perrier. 
Okay, sir. Three of each. Would you like anything else? 
The fruit basket was great. I need a few more apples, please. 
Perrier, Jim Beam, and apples. Is that it for now? 
Yes, one last thing 
Your order will be brought to you momentarily, sir.
