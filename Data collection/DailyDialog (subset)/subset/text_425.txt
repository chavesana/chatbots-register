[G:] Fair-Priced Fares, how may I help you? 
How much is a round-trip ticket to London? 
When did you plan to go, sir? 
In the second week of September. 
The second week of September is still in the high-season, so the cheapest tickets are $650. The high season lasts until the 15th, so fares after that date are cheaper. 
In that case, I'll go after the 15th. How much are the off-season fares? 
Our cheapest ticket is $550 on American Airlines. 
Okay, I'll take it. ( to be continued )
