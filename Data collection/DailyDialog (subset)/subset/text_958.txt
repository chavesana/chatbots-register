[G:] Maintenance Department. May I come in? 
[T:] Come in, please. 
[G:] Did you call us? 
[T:] Yes. The television is not working properly. 
[G:] What's the problem? 
[T:] The remote control doesn't work. I turned on the television, but I can't change the channel. 
[G:] Let me have a look. I think the batteries should be changed. Let me replace them with new ones. Now, it's working. 
[T:] That's great. 
[G:] Is there anything else I can do for you? 
[T:] No, thanks. 
[G:] If you have any problems, just call us. 
[T:] OK. Thank you.
