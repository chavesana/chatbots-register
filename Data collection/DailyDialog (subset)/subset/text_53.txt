[G:] Good morning, sir. Are you checking out now? 
[T:] Yes. Steven Smith, room 609. 
[G:] Fine. This is your bill, Mr. Smith. Four nights at 100 dollars each, and here are the meals that you had in our hotel. That makes a total of 660 dollars. 
[T:] Can I pay by credit card? 
[G:] Certainly. May I have your card, please? 
[T:] Here you are. 
[G:] Please sign your name here. 
[T:] OK. Is it possible to leave my luggage here until I'm ready to leave this afternoon? I'd like to say goodbye to some of my friends. 
[G:] Yes, we'll keep it for you. How many pieces of your luggage? 
[T:] Just three. I'll be back at 3:00 p.m. 
[G:] That's fine. Have a nice day! 
[T:] Thank you. See you later.
