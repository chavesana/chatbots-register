[G:] Good morning, sir, where are you going? 
[T:] I'm going to England by flight B. E. 987. 
[G:] When is your flight? 
[T:] 10:00 a.m. When am I supposed to check in? 
[G:] We are checking in. May I have your ticket? And your health certificate and your luggage, please. 
[T:] Here you are. 
[G:] Are you keeping this small bag as carry-on luggage, sir? 
[T:] Yes. 
[G:] You must weigh that as well. 
[T:] All right. 
[G:] Your luggage is two pounds over, I am afraid there'll be an excess luggage charge, sir. 
[T:] How much must I pay? 
[G:] It's 10 yuan. 
[T:] Here you are. 
[G:] This is your luggage check, which you must show when you disembark at your destination, and here is your boarding pass and your ticket. 
[T:] Thanks. 
[G:] Now please wait until your flight is called. There are about twenty-five minutes to go. 
[T:] I'm a little nervous. I have never flown before. 
[G:] There is nothing at all to worry about. Once you're in the air, it's just like sitting in your own living room. It's going to be a very pleasant flight.
