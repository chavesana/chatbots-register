[G:] Good afternoon, ladies. May I help you? 
Can we have two adjoining double rooms, sir? 
Have you made a reservation, ladies? 
I'm afraid not. 
One moment, please. I have to check if there are rooms available. I'm sorry, ladies. We have only two double rooms available but they are on different floors. Would you mind that? 
We prefer on the same floor because we will probably chat late at night. 
Then may I suggest a family suite? We have just had a cancellation. 
What is it like? 
It's a big room with a king-size double bed and two single beds. We could also add rollaways. 
That's great! How much is it? 
Two thousand hongkong dollars per night plus ten percent service charge and five percent government government tax. 
That's fine. 
But ladies, the room is not yet ready. There will be a delay of about half an hour. Perhaps you could fill in the registration form first, and then rest in our lobby for a while. We will let you know when the room is ready. 
Alright, hanks. 
Ladies, hotel policy requires one night's room charge as deposit. 
Do you take traveler's checks? 
Yes, we do, madam. Thank you, madam. Here's our welcome brochure with all the information of our facilities. My name is Johnny. If you need any help at all, do let me know. I'm at your service.
