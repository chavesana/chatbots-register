[T:] Hello, I set up my laundry yesterday, are they being ready? 
They will be ready this afternoon. 
Oh, no. I ’ m leaving for Japan at eleven this morning. 
Is that right? We are very sorry 
I thought it the same day service. Anyway, please do a hurry. 
I ’ m afraid... be can returned by eleven o ’ clock. 
Well, then. Would you send to Japan, please? 
Yes, we ’ ll do so.
