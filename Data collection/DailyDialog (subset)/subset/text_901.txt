[T:] Hello! How do I restock my minibar? 
You've drunk everything, sir? 
I finished it all. 
Do you want the whole minibar, or just certain items? 
Send me up three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam. 
That's three Jim Beams and three Perriers. Anything else, sir? 
The apples in my room were delicious. Bring me a few more, please. 
Okay. Are you sure there isn't anything else? 
You know, some grape juice would be really nice, too. 
Be patient for just a few minutes, sir, and someone will be at your door.
