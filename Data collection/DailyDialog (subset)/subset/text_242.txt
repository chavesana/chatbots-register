[T:] Hello, this is Chen Kun. I am booked on flight LJ88 for Barcelona on Jan. 19th. 
Hold on please... Yes, you are booked already. 
Now I am afraid I can't get to the airport on that day. I want to change my flight for the 21st.Is that all right? 
I am sorry.Flight LJ88 0n that day is full. What about 22? 
Fine.Thank you so much.
