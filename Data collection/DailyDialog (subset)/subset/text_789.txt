[T:] Oh, what a relief! Thank you very much for your help, Miss. 
You're welcome. 
Excuse me, Miss. My friend is sick. 
Is he? Yes, he looks pale. Is there anything I can do for him? 
Yes.Please give him some water. 
Certainly. 
And do you have any medicine for airsickness? 
Well, yes. I'll give him the medicine, too. 
I appreciate your help.
