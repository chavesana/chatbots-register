[G:] Sir, what's wrong with you? 
I have a spasm of nausea and dizziness. 
Have you ever suffered from airsickness before? You're probably airsick. 
No, this is the first time on a plane. Maybe you are right.. Please get me some pills. 
OK. I will get some for you. There's an airsickness bag behind the seat in front of you.Please wait me for a moment. ( Go away for a few minutes, and now she comes back. ) Here are two pills. And the water is in the glass too.Please take the pills with water. 
Thank you very much. ( Take the pills. ) 
Are you feeling better now? 
Much better now. Thanks again. 
My pleasure.
