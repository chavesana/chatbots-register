[T:] So, what do you plan to do today? 
There is a Matisse exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. Larry and I will go. 
Did you buy tickets already? 
No. Do we need tickets? 
Well, probably. Probably you will have to wait in line if you don't have tickets. 
Outside or inside? 
Outside, on the sidewalk. 
Hmm. It's very cold today.But I brought my jacket. Maybe it will be alright to wait. 
The MYOMA is very popular. There will be a lot of people. 
MYOMA? What's that? 
Oh, sorry.It stands for the Museum of Modern Art. It's an acronym. M O M A MYOMA. 
I see. Do you have any suggestions for other things we should do? 
I suggest you go to the Jewish Museum.It ' s not far from the Guggenheim, near Central Park. It is really very interesting.Also, there is a great museum of medieval European art further up north.It ' s called the Cloisters. 
How can we get up there? 
You can take a bus. 
But Larry says the neighborhoods in the north are dangerous.
