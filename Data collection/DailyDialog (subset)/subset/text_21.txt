[T:] I enjoy the folk song and dance show very much. 
I'm glad you appreciate our folk music. But a live performance is much more interesting. 
I can't wait anymore. When does the performance start? 
The show starts at 7 and is over at around 10 o'clock p.m. 
( After the show ) It's an excellent musical. The acting was very expressive and the songs and dancing were superb. 
I'm glad you enjoyed it. It's had long run, but the house has always been full. 
What do you think of the leading actors? 
Personally I liked the main character. He was true to type. 
You are a better judge. I don't know the play well enough.
