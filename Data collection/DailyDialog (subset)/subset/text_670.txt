[G:] May I see your boarding pass? 
Here you go. 
48C. It's on your left hand side. 
Thank you. 
Please fasten your seat belt, miss. 
Oops! I forgot. 
Also, please place your carry-on luggage either under your seat or in the overhead compartment. 
I think I'll put my bag in the overhead compartment. 
Allow me to give you a hand.
