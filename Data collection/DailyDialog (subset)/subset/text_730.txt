[T:] I need some more amenities, please. 
I'm not sure I'm following you, sir. 
Specifically, I'm talking about the little things, like soap and shampoo. 
Oh, now I understand! So, you've already used up all your amenities? 
No, I'm not even halfway through my supply. 
I'm losing you, sir. What's the problem? 
What's the use of going to a hotel if you don't take home souvenirs? 
Okay, I got it. You're collecting souvenirs! 
There you go. My friends expect me to bring home souvenirs. 
Have you visited our souvenir shop, sir? It's loaded with all kinds of items. 
I've never paid for a hotel souvenir in my life, and I don't intend to start now. 
Sir, housekeeping will bring you a basketful of amenities momentarily.
