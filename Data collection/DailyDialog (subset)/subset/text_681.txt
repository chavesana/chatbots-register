[G:] Hello. Front desk. 
Yes. This is Bob Robinson. I ’ m calling from room number 627. 
Hi, Bob. What can I do for you? 
Is it possible to change to another room? 
Could you please tell me why? 
My room is facing the swimming pool. It ’ s noisy for me. I have a problem sleeping. And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator. 
So you need a quiet side room on the lower floor. 
You ’ re right. 
Okay. Let me check for a room on the first floor. 
Thank you. 
I ’ Ve only two rooms on the first floor. How about room 108? 
That ’ s fine. Can I move now? 
Sure. I ’ ll send the bellman to help you. 
Oh, thank you kindly. 
You ’ re welcome.
