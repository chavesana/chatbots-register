[G:] Front desk. May I help you? 
[T:] I'm going to check out tomorrow but will be back in a week's time. Can I leave my luggage here? 
[G:] Yes, sure. We do have a storage service. When will you be checking out tomorrow? 
[T:] About nine-thirty in the morning. 
[G:] Then shall we arrange the bellboy to pick up your luggage at 9:00? 
[T:] Sure. 
[G:] May I have your room number, please? 
[T:] 1218. 
[G:] 1218. We'll collect you luggage at 9:00 tomorrow. Would you then come to the Front Desk to get your storage receipt, please? 
[T:] Thank you very much, bye! 
[G:] You're welcome. Goodbye.
