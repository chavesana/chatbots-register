[T:] Excuse me. Where is the Beijing railway station? 
You can take the subway to get there 
How long will I take it to get there? 
It â€™ s takes only about 10 minutes 
May I take a bus or a taxi to get there? 
You can take No. 1 bus or taxi 
Excuse me. Sir. Where is the No. 1 bus stop? 
Pleas turn right at the traffic lights. 
Thank you very much
