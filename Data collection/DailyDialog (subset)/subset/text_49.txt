[G:] What's the matter, sir? You look pale. 
[T:] I feel dizzy and weak. And I'm having this pain in my ear. I think I am sick. 
[G:] Are you often traveling by plane? 
[T:] No, this is the second time. 
[G:] That's right. It's normal if you don't often take the plane. Just relax a little bit. 
[T:] Why this happens to me when I am on the plane? I feel bad. 
[G:] Don't worry, sir. It's just because of the lower pressure. 
[T:] What should I do about it? 
[G:] You may feel much better if you chew some gum or peanuts. 
[T:] OK, thanks. Does it work really? I'll give a try. 
[G:] Are you feeling better now? Do you need some pills? 
[T:] Much better. Thank you. I just feel tired but I can't fall asleep. 
[G:] So, you'd better wear this eyeshade and you will sleep well. 
[T:] I am not used to wearing that. Thanks. 
[G:] If you try to adapt yourself to your destination's local time, you'll feel more comfortable. So please try to sleep, and have meals according to Los Angeles's time. 
[T:] Thank you so much. 
[G:] You are welcome. Please press the button when you need any help.
