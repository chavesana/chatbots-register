[G:] May I help you? 
Yes, I would like to check in. 
Do you have a reservation? 
Yes, my name is Carol Tiang. That's spelled J - I - A - N - G. 
I'm sorry, Ma'am. I can't find anything under that name.Do you have your confirmation number? 
No, I don't have it with me.But I know I have a reservation. My husband made it for me last month. 
Well, let me look again. How do you spell your first name, Ma'am? 
C - A - R - O - L. Carol. 
I don't find a Carol in the computer for today. I have a Carol Larson here. But that reservation is for next Monday. 
No, that's not me. My name is Tiang, not Larson. My husband reserved for me. 
Are you sure he used your name, Ma'am? Maybe he reserved under his name. 
His name is Lin, L - I - N. 
I'm sorry. I have nothing here. 
Miss, I know he made this reservation for me.
