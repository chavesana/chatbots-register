[T:] Hi, I'm John Sandals, and I have a reservation. 
Would you show me your ID, sir, please? 
Here you go. 
Thank you very much. Now, sir, do you have a credit card? 
Certainly! Would you like my American Express card? 
Regrettably, Mr. Sandals, we accept only MasterCard or VISA. 
I thought American Express was accepted everywhere. Never mind. Here's my VISA. 
Thanks. You're in room 507, a big, nonsmoking room, with a queen bed. Is that okay, sir? 
Yes, that's just fine. 
I'm happy to hear that. Here is your key. Just dial 0 if you need anything.
