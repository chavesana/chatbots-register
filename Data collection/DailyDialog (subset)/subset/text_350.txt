[T:] I'd like to pay my bill now. 
Your name and room number, please? 
Tom Wilson in Room 306. 
Have you used any hotel services this morning? 
No. 
OK. You have stayed for four nights at 90 US dollars each, and here are the meals that you had at the hotel. That makes a total of 660 US dollars. 
Can I pay by credit card? 
Of course. Please sign your name here.
