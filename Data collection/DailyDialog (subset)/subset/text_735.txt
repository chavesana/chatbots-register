[T:] I am checking out. Here is the key to my room. 
Thank you. I'll just print out your receipt, and then you're free to go. Here you go! 
Thanks. 
If you don't mind me asking, how did you enjoy your stay at New York Hotel? 
This hotel could use some insecticide, but my time in New York was thoroughly delightful. 
That's very honest of you. Rest assured that this hotel will have no insects next time.
