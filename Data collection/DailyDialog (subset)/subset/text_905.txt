[T:] I want to change rooms. In fact, I want a refund for tonight! 
And the problem is, sir? 
Cockroaches have taken over my room! 
My apologies, sir. We'll give you a new room and refund the value of your current room. 
Thank you. I want to continue to be able to recommend this hotel to others. 
We always try to serve our guests in the most agreeable way possible.
