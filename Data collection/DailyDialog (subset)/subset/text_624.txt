[G:] Put all baggage on the conveyor belt. Walk through the detector age one at a time, please. 
Excuse me, ma'ma. Could you walk back through the doorway again, please? 
What for? 
Airport security. Could you empty your pockets over here, please? 
Really? I'm in a hurry. All right. 
Ah, a set of keys. 
I'm embarrassed! I forgot completely about them. I'm terribly sorry. 
That's all right. Enjoy your flight. 
Thank you.
