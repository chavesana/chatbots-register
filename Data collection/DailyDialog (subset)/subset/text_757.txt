[T:] Can you get me a taxi? 
We offer various types of transportation. Perhaps you'd like to upgrade to a private vehicle? 
Thanks, but no thanks. A taxi will do just fine. 
In that case, how about a limo? Then you can travel in style. 
No, I hate limousines. They're gas guzzlers. 
Got it, sir. Where would you like the taxi to take you? 
My destination is Rockefeller Center. 
What time do you want to leave the hotel? 
As soon as possible. 
I'll call the taxi immediately, sir. 
Okay, I'm coming downstairs now. 
A brand new taxi is pulling up now.
