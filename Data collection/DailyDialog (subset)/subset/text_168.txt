[G:] Good morning, Madam. This is room service, may I help you? 
Good morning. I'd like to reserve some rooms for a tourist party. 
All right. What kind of room would you like? 
You see, we are tourists whose requests are different, so please tell me more about it, will you? 
It's my pleasure. We have single rooms, double rooms, suites and luxury suites, ect. Well, here is an introduction to our hotel. 
That's great. I'd like to book four single rooms, five double rooms and three suites. 
All right, madam. For which dates do you want to book the rooms? 
From tomorrow till January 8th. That's five days in all. 
I see. Now please fill out the form. 
Here you are. Is everything OK? 
Just a minute, madam. You should pay a deposit of 500 yuan beforehand. 
OK. Here you are. 
Thank you. Please keep this receipt. 
Thank you. By the way, is there any preferential rate for the party? 
Yes, there is a 15 percent discount.
