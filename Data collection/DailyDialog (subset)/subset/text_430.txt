[G]: Good morning, sir. Here is the hotel's sauna room. What can I do for you? 
Yes. This is the first time I've come here. Could you please tell me something about it? 
Sure Those who have heart disease or high blood pressure are not allowed to take sauna, for their sake. 
Thank you for telling me about this. What should I do here? 
First, change your shoes to slippers. Then walk up to the changing room to get prepared for a shower. 
OK. How about after the shower? 
After the shower, step into the washroom with birch switches, dip them in the warm water and briskly whisk them over your skin. 
That sounds comfortable. 
Yes, then enter the bathroom, There is a stove tired with wood in the room, and on the top of the stove, there is a pile of stones, which keep the heat. Throw some water on the stones, and dry steam is given off.
