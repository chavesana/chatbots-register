[T:] I'm in 507. I have a few problems with my room. 
What is that problem, sir? 
There are cockroaches in my room. 
Are you sure, sir? Flies I could believe, but cockroaches? 
I've counted nine different cockroaches, and I accidentally stepped on another one. 
Sir, we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel. 
You dare to doubt me? 
I'm sorry, sir. Let me transfer you to my supervisor.
