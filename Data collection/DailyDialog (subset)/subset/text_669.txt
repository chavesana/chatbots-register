[T:] Excuse me, could you please take a picture for us? 
Sure. Where would you like to stand? 
Over here with the waterfall in the background, please. 
OK. 
Then just press the black button all the way down. 
Are you ready? Here we go. Say Cheese! 
It could be the battery. Let me Check it. 
Is it the battery? 
Yes, the battery is dead. 
Do you have an extra battery? 
No, I've only got one. OK, thank you all the same. 
If you don't mind, you can use my camera and leave your address with me so I can send you the photos later. 
That's so kind of you. Thank you very much! 
You're welcome. Now smile...
