[T:] I have a little problem with room 507. 
Problems are what we're here for, sir. Please tell me your problem. 
This room is filthy with cockroaches. 
Were you wearing your glasses when you noticed them, sir? 
I've already seen nine of them and, as they say, eight is enough! 
Sir, sometimes a fast elevator ride makes our guests see spots. 
You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement! 
I'm very sorry, sir. Will you please hold while I transfer you to my supervisor?
