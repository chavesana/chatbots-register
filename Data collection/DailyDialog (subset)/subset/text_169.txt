[T:] I will travel to Southeast Asia this summer, so I need to exchange some US dollars. Can I get the foreign currency at any bank? 
I don't think you can. In China, our currency is not freely convertible yet. 
Do you mean there is no way to get any foreign money? 
No. You can go to the Bank of China to exchange some US dollars at the current exchange rate of the day you exchange them. The maximum amount you can exchange is $2,000. 
Only $2,000? Are there any other ways to get the money exchanged? 
The only official way is to go to Bank of China. 
I'd better take more dollars with me. It seems that I need to borrow some from my friends.
