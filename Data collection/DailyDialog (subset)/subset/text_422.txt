[G:] My god, it's such a lovely lake! The lake has a water surface of 56 square kilometers. 
No wonder it looks so huge. 
We are now walking on what is in fact an island. Here we get one of the 10 sceneries of the West Lake, Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake. 
Why is it called Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake? 
It's so named because in the pavilion over there the great poet Bai Buyi of the Tang Dynasty would take a rest after drinking a little too much, and watch the moon over the lake. 
Very romantic. 
Now let's board the boat and have a ride on the lake. 
Sure ( They get on the boat ). 
Wang, what's that building over there? It looks like some sort of a huge pavilion. 
You are right. That's the Heart of Lake Pavilion, situated on an islet.It was built in 1552 and is the largest pavilion on the West Lake. Oh, here we are at the Little Yingzhou island. Let's get off the boat. Please watch your steps.
