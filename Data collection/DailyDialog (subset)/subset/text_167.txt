[T:] I'm going to the United Stated to attend my daughter's commencement. 
How nice! Are you going to convert some RIB to US dollars? 
Yes. But I will not take much cash with me I can ask the bank to give me the traveler's checks. So it will be safer. 
How can you cash them when you arrive in the United States? 
I will go to the bank, give them my check, show them one piece of my identifications, and the most important thing is that I should sign my name to endorse the check. 
It sounds quite simple. Next time when I travel abroad, I will apply for this kind of check too.
