[T:] Hi, I'm checking in. The last name is Rama. 
[G:] Yes, here is your reservation. You have a standard room reserved for two nights. Is that right? 
[T:] Actually, no. It should be a suite. I had booked a non-smoking king. 
[G:] Oh, my mistake. The reservation is for a suite and it is a non-smoking room with a king bed. I'm sorry for the error. 
[T:] That's okay. I'm here a little early. Is it possible to check in right now? 
[G:] Sure, that's no problem. May I have your credit card? We need a credit card on file for your room charges and incidentals. 
[T:] Here it is. 
[G:] Okay, now if you could please verify the room rate here, initial next to the X, and sign right here. How many keys will you need? 
[T:] Oh, just one. 
[G:] Okay, you're all set. You're in room 1201. Take the elevators to the 12th floor and it will be on your left. Do you need any help with your bags? 
[T:] No, I'm fine. Thanks. 
[G:] Enjoy your stay.
