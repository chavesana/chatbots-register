[G:] Every honored guests, welcome to Hang Thou. Now we are visiting Tiger-running Spring. 
[T:] How can we relate tiger to this spot, Miss Zhang? 
[G:] Its name originates from a legend that two tigers run here and made a hole, and then a spring gushed out from it. 
[T:] How ignorant I am! 
[G:] The Longing Tea and the Tiger-running Spring water are always considered as the "Two Wonders in West Lake." 
[T:] I know that tea. It smells fragrant. 
[G:] That's right. All my guests, attention please. We will have half an hour to visit the spring and take photos. And next spot will be the Moon Reflected in Three Pools. 
[T:] Janice, David, come here. We take some photos here. I can't imagine how beautiful it is!
