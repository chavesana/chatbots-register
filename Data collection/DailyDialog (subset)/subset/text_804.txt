[T:] I can't get into my room. I mean I left my room key inside. 
I see, sir.Those two ladies in front of your room did the same thing twenty minutes ago. 
Oh, did they? Well, would you give us an extra key to the room? 
I'm afraid we have no extra key.So I'll send somebody to your room. 
By the way, what should I do with the key when I go out? 
Please drop it at the front desk when you leave tie hotel.
