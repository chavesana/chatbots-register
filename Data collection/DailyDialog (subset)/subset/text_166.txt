[G:] Please pull your table down. It's lunch hour. 
All right. 
What would you like, sir? 
What would you suggest? 
You may choose from the fish and beef. 
I'd like the beef. 
Here you are. Would you like a cup of tea or coffee? 
No, I'd rather have a glass of juice, please. What kinds do you have? 
We have a selection of orange, apple, grape and lemonade. 
I'll have a glass of lemonade. More ice, please. 
All right. Will there be anything else? 
Could you give me more paper napkins? 
Sure. Here you are. 
Thanks. 
You're welcome. Enjoy your meal. Press the call button if you need any more help.
