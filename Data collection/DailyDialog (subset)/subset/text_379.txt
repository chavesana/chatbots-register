[T:] We're now staying at the Holiday Inn. How do we get to the airport? 
We have shuttle buses leaving for the airport from downtown every 20 minutes The bus stops at Holiday Inn as well. Be sure to get on the bus before 30. 
What is the earliest one? 
At 7 am. It takes about one hour to get to the airport. So it'll be right for your timing. 
OK, thank you. By the way, what can I do if I want to put off my flight? 
Your tickets are valid for one year.If you want to change flight, you just go to the airline's ticketing office and have it reconfirmed. But you have to fly the same airlines. 
OK. What can I do if l want to cancel the ticket? 
In that case. you can get a refund with a certain percentage of the original fare deducted as the service charge. 
That's reasonable. OK, thank you very much.
