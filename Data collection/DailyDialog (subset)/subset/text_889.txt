[T:] I need to cancel my reservation. I have personal matters that need fixing. 
That's not a problem. Just give me your name, phone number, and date of visit. 
Rudy Randolph, 818-555-1234, April 9 through 15. 
I see your info here on the screen. I'll hit just one button, sir, and you're cancelled. 
Thank you. I'm glad that wasn't too much of a bother. 
It's a pleasure.
