[G] Hey Mei Hong, how are you getting to Xi ’ an next week? 
I ’ m not sure yet. I may take the train but then again I might take the bus. 
Yeah but the bus takes a long time. You could fly - it ’ s not so expensive these days. 
Really? Maybe I ’ ll do that then. 
Ok well, you let me know your schedule and I ’ ll book a ticket for you. 
Ok. Thanks for that!
