[G:] Please put your baggage on the counter and open it, let me have a look. 
[T:] Yes, sir. Please examine it. 
[G:] Anything subject to duty in your suitcase? 
[T:] No, sir. Nothing except my personal belongings, such as clothes, notebooks and some gifts. 
[G:] Any cigarettes or liquor? 
[T:] I have cigarettes for my own use. 
[G:] I think you'll have to pay some duty on these cigarettes because they exceed the quota. And this article is liable for duty. 
[T:] How much duty should I pay? 
[G:] One hundred dollars. 
[T:] Here is the money. 
[G:] Just a moment. I'll make out your duty memo. ( Writing and giving the memo to Mr. Green ) Take it and pay the girl over there. 
[T:] Thank you.
