[G:] Front Desk, may I help you? 
Yes, I'd like to move to another room. 
Is there anything uncomfortable in your room? 
Yes. The air-conditioner in this room doesn't work. 
May I have your room number, sir? 
Wang Wei. Room 1212. 
OK. Mr. Wang, may I send a room attendant to check it for you first? 
All right. 
( 15 minutes later ) Mr. Wang, we are deeply sorry for the inconvenience. The maintenance might last for a long time, may I offer you another room? 
Yes. No problem.
