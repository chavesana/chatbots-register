[G:] Would you mind telling me the purpose of your visit to the U. K.? 
I am here on business. 
May I see your passport? 
Of course, here you are. 
Would you please open the suitcase? What are these? 
They are two cameras. 
Do you have anything to declare? 
Yes, I have one carton of cigarettes and a bottle of whiskey. 
OK, you're through now.
