[T:] I need something to eat, please. 
Tell me what you're hungry for. 
I feel like champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare. 
Unfortunately, we're out of filet mignon at the moment. May I suggest the porterhouse instead? 
Well, I prefer filet, but porterhouse is good, too. 
Perhaps I could interest you in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne? 
Just the champagne will be fine, thank you. 
You'll see this charge on your amenities account. 
That's fine. 
It won't be long until your food is delivered. I know you'll enjoy it.
