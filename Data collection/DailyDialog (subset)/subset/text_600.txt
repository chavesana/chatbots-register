[G:] Good morning, sir. Can I see your boarding pass, please? 
Here you are. 
Excuse me, sir. This is your passport. 
Really? Ugh... Is there any difference? 
Yes. As a matter of fact, you can't board the plane without boarding pass. 
Gee. I must have left it in my hotel room. 
I'm sorry sir. I can't let you pass. 
But when does the plane take off? 
Ugh, in about thirty minutes, sir. 
Oh, my God! What do I do now? Bone head. 
Calm down, sir. You are creating a commotion. 
Is that me? 
Could be. 
Oh, thank God. Thank you, I'll be right back.
