[G:] Is there anything I can do for you? 
Yes, I joined your group of bus tour this morning. You promised the journey will last 3 hours and we will visit 15 sightseeing spots. 
Yes, sir. We promised that. 
But have 2 - hour journey. 
Really? I am sorry, sir. We will look into this matter. Would you please wait a moment here?
