[T:] Hello. I'd like to get a seat to New York City on a flight leaving sometime before this Friday. 
I'm afraid Thera isn't any direct light before Friday. What about a non-direct one? You have to make a change in Detroit. 
Well, in that case, that's fine. I want a first class ticket on Thursday. 
Would you like to pay in cash or by card? 
Cash, please.
