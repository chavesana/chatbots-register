[G:] Room service. Can I help you? 
This is room 1019. I would like to order breakfast. 
What would you like, sir? 
One orange juice, scrambled eggs with bacon, toast and coffee. 
It will take about 20 minutes, sir. Is that all right? 
Yes, it is. Oh, by the way, could you also bring me today's paper? 
Of course, sir.
