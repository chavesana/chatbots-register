[T:] I'd like you to bring me some food. 
Just name it, sir. 
Please send up a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare. 
Regrettably, we're currently out of filet mignon. May I suggest the porterhouse instead? 
Sure, I love porterhouse, too. 
Would you be interested in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne? 
I'd love to, but I'm allergic to strawberries. 
Okay, no strawberries tonight. The items will be charged to your amenities account. 
Go right ahead. 
Our staff will bring you your order in as short a time as possible.
