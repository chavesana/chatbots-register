[G:] After you 
[T:] Thank you! 
[T:] What's the weather like in your country? I suppose it must be warmer than here. 
[G:] Oh, yes. We have rather mild winters. It always has much sunshine in winter. But it was very foggy when I left two days ago. I knew it would be colder here, but I thought there would be a lot of snow. 
[T:] We don't have much snow in winter in Beijing. In fact, we haven't had any so far this winter. The winter is rather long, but the cold is generally not severe. The temperature seldom gets as low as ten below zero Centigrade. 
[T:] What is the temperature today, do you know? 
[G:] About freezing point, I think.But the morning's forecast said that we are going to have a very cold spell in the next few days - and the temperature will probably drop to 10 or 15 degrees below zero. 
[T:] Oh, I'm very lucky that my wife let me take a heavy overcoat. 
[G:] It is considerate of your wife. 
[T:] Yes, she is. By the way, what is the best season in Beijing? 
[G:] Fall is the best season in Beijing. It's neither hot nor cold. The sky is clear and blue. There's hardly any wind, only a slight breeze which is hardly noticeable. And we have plenty of sunshine too. 
Really? Then I will come to Beijing in the fall next time. 
[G:] Good, you are welcome.
