[T:] Can you tell me about a nice restaurant to go to? 
Of course! How much would you like to spend on your meal? 
My date is quite sophisticated. She would expect nothing less than the best. 
Well, how about our own hotel restaurant? It's conveniently located and has a three-star rating. 
That's a good idea, except I want to go out, not stay in. Something else, maybe? 
Well, how about Gramercy Tavern? It's a very popular tourist spot, with great food and music. 
That sounds good! Could you call them to see if I can get a reservation? 
Of course, sir. You've made a good choice.
