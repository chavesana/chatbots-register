[T:] Oh, I'm starving. I'd like to try some real Chinese cuisine. What would you recommend, waiter? 
Well, it depends. You see, there are eight famous Chinese for instance, the Sichuan cuisine, and the Hunan cuisine. 
They are both spicy hot, I've heard. 
That's right. If you like hot dishes, you could try some. 
They might be too hot for me. 
Then there's the Cantonese cuisine and the Kiangsu cuisine. Most southerners like them. 
What about any special Beijing dishes? 
There's the Beijing roast duck. 
Oh, yes. I've heard a lot about it. I'd like very much to try it. Where can I find it? 
You can find it in most restaurants, but the best place is certainly Quanjude Restaurant. 
Is it near here? 
Not too near but not too far either. A taxi will take you there in 15 minutes, If the traffic is not too bad, I mean. 
Well, thank you for your information. But what is the name of that restaurant again? 
Let me write it down on this slip of paper for you. You can show it to the taxi-driver. 
That's very kind of you. Thanks a lot.
