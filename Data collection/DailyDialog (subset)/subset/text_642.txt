[T:] Do I need a visa? 
No, I shouldn ’ t think so. But you must take your passport of course. 
Yes, I know. I must get my traveler ’ s check and some foreign currency. 
Yes, you need the traveler ’ s check but you needn ’ t get any foreign currency. You can have my US Dollars, I don ’ t need them. 
Really? That ’ s very good of you, Helen. But I must get a new suitcase, my old one needs repairing. 
You needn ’ t buy one. You can have mine. 
That ’ s very kind of you, Helen. I hope you don ’ t mind my leaving you like this. I need a holiday. It won ’ t be long. 
Don ’ t be silly, John. I ’ m going with you. It ’ s necessary for me to have a holiday too.
