[G:] Good evening, sir. Are you Mr Jim Stewart from the States? 
[T:] Ah, yes, that's right. 
[G:] Glad to meet you, Mr Stewart. I'm the guide from Pacific Tour Agency. My name is Zhang Hua. 
[T:] Hello, I was just looking for the guide. 
[G:] I'm always at your service, sir. By the way, did you have a pleasant trip? 
[T:] Not bad. But I've made too many flights these days. I could hardly remember how many take-offs and landings I've been through these three days. I think we all feel a bit tired. 
[G:] Well, shall we go to the hotel right now? I've already made a reservation for you. 
[T:] Wonderful. I'm eager to take a sauna as soon as possible. 
[G:] So we must get you to the hotel as soon as possible. I hope to see you refreshed and revitalized tomorrow morning, as we are going to visit the Great Wall. 
[T:] I am sure we will. Actually, we are looking forward to seeing the great wonder. 
[G:] Come this way, please. The coach is waiting outside. 
[T:] Fine, let's go.
