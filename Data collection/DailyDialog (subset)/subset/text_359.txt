[G:] Good morning, sir. What can I do for you? 
I'm Bill. I'm in Room 908. Can you change the room for me? It's too noisy. My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made. She said it was too much for her. 
I'm awfully sorry, sir. I do apologize. Room 908 is at the end of the corridor. It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet. 
Anyhow, I'd like to change our room. 
No problem, sir. We'll manage it, but we don't have any spare room today. Could you wait till tomorrow? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning. There'll be some rooms for you to choose from. 
All right. I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep. 
Be sure. I'll make a note of that. Everything will be taken care of. And if there is anything more you need, please let us know.
