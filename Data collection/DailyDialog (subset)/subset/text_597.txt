[T:] May, is this the Hall of Ancient China? 
Yes. Look at these historical relics here, amazing! 
Why are they all in glass boxes? 
For protection. Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air. 
So there isn't air in the glass boxes? 
No, there isn't. They are all vacuumed. 
I wonder how old these things are, thousands of years? 
Yeah, they all come from a very ancient time. 
Hey, look at the three-leg cup. I've seen it on TV. 
The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago. It's priceless! 
Yeah, it has no value at all. Who will use this cup today? 
Danny, priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it. 
Oh, it does?
