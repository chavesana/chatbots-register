[T:] Have you ever been to Xi ’ an? 
Yes, I ’ Ve been there several times on business trips. But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city. 
I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring. I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day. Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either. You know, the sites interests a food in scenery, food is a key factor when visiting a place. 
I agree. As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects. That is frightening. 
Sure it is. Is it convenient to get there by plane? 
Well, the airport is quite far from the downtown area, but it is still more convenient than taking the train.
