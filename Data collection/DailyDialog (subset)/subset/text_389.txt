[G:] We still have an important attraction. 
What is that? 
Melbourne Zoo. 
What's special about Melbourne Zoo? 
The place is a must-see. This zoo was built in 1862, and it's the oldest zoo in the world, and still among the best. There are more than 3,000 species of animals here, including the popular kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, and wombats. 
Are the animals caged? 
Most animals are not locked up in tiny cages. Rather, they are set in almost natural surroundings or well-tended gardens. 
That's really special. 
Of course, I'm sure you will like it.
