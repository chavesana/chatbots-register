[G:] Good morning, sir. What can I do for you? 
I am leaving at 10, so I'd like to settle my account now. 
Yes, sir. May I have your room number? 
My room number is 1010 and the name is Ted Black. 
Right, just wait a minute. I will get your bill ready for you right away. 
Thanks. 
Have you used your mini-bar since breakfast? 
No, I haven't. 
Very good sir. Here is your bill. Please check and sign it. 
Ok. Excuse me, what's this charge for? 
That's for the breakfast you ordered from the service. 
Oh, yes. It's on Wednesday morning. Sorry about that. 
That's all right. Well, it's all together $260. 
Here you are. 
Thank you. Have a nice trip.
