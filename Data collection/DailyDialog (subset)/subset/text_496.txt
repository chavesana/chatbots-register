[G:] Northward Airways, good morning. May I help you? 
Yes, do you have any flights to Sydney next Tuesday afternoon? 
One moment, please... Yes. There's a flight at 16:45 and one at 18:00. 
That's fine. Could you tell me how much a return flight costs? I'll be staying three weeks. 
Economy, business class or first class ticket? 
Economy, please. 
That would be 346 Euro. 
OK. Could I make a reservation? 
Certainly. Which flight would you like? 
The 16:45, please. 
Could I have your name, please? 
My name is Mary Jones, that's M-A-R-Y J-O-N-E-S. 
How would you like to pay, Ms. Jones? 
Can I pay at the check-in desk when I pick up my ticket? 
Yes, but you will have to confirm this reservation at least two hours before departure time. 
I see. 
Now you have been booked, Ms. Jones. The flight leaves at 16:45, and your arrival in Sydney will be at 9:00 a.m., local time. The flight number is NWA 476. 
Thank you.
