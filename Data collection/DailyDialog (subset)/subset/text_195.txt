[G:] Good morning, room reservations. Can I help you? 
[T:] Yes, my name is Peter. I have made a reservation for a single room from June 18th to June 21st. I'd like to make some changes. The reservation should only be to June 20th. 
[G:] A single room from June 18th to 20th. Is that correct? 
[T:] Yes. 
[G:] OK. Do you need a limousine service? 
[T:] That's exactly what I want. How much does it charge? 
[G:] A hundred and eighty yuan for one way. We have a counter at the airport where our representative will lead you to the car. 
[T:] It sounds good. I'll take that. 
[G:] Thank you, sir. We look forward to serving you.
