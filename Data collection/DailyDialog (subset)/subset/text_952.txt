[T:] Excuse me. Who is the person responsible for handling complaints here? I would like to make a few complaints. 
[G:] I am the manager here. You can complain to me. How may I help you? 
[T:] Here is the thing. I was woke up by strange noises of the telephone several times last night. Even I unplugged it, it wouldn't stop beeping. I am also not satisfied with the housekeeping service in my room. So I want to change to a cleaner and quieter room. 
[G:] I apologize for everything disturbing you. We will give another room to you right now. Please wait a moment.
