[T:] It's my first time to come to Bangkok. Could you recommend some places for me? 
[G:] Well, it depends on what you have. 
[T:] What do you mean? 
[G:] It takes only one day and you could experience almost all the famous spots in the city, I don't think you would like to miss it. 
[T:] Sounds persuasive. How much will you charge for it? 
[G:] 50 dollars per person. 
[T:] That's reasonable. Will you take care of meals for the day? 
[G:] Of course. Please take it easy. 
[T:] I see. May I know the schedule? 
[G:] Why not?
