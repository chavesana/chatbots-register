[T:] Hello. I'm leaving. Here is my key. 
Just one second, sir, and I'll give you your receipt. Here you go. 
Thank you very much. 
Sir, did you enjoy your stay here? 
Well, most of my time here was pleasant. And New York itself is fantastic. 
I'm glad you enjoyed the city, anyway. But please don't think too unkindly of us.
