[G:] Will you be checking in any baggage today? 
Yes, I have two large suitcases and one box. 
If you need baggage tags, they are found in the box on your right. 
No, thank you.They are already tagged with my name and address. 
You are allowed an additional two carry-on items. 
Good, I have my backpack and my camera tripod. 
I see. All carry-on items must be able to fit under the seat or in the overhead bin. 
Both my items will fit under the seat or in the overhead bin. 
You will need to send the tripod as luggage because it is too long to fit in our gauge box for carry-on items. 
I cannot let anything happen to that tripod.Can you guarantee it will not be damaged if I check it in? 
No, I can't. Perhaps your stewardess will help you to find a place to store it. 
Good idea. I will ask the stewardess to help me store my tripod.
