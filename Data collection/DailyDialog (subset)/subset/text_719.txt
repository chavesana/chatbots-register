[T:] Hello! I'd like to get busy on my computer, but I need some broadband. 
There's an Ethernet cable in your room. Just plug it into the back of your laptop. 
Uh-oh! I can't use Ethernet. My computer is wireless only. 
That's okay. I can tell you about some alternatives we have. 
Any alternative that works will be great. 
Well, there's our computer lab on the first floor. 
That sounds good. What's the charge? 
The lab and the computers are no charge, but you have to pay for whatever you print. 
That sounds good. Now, how about the other alternatives? 
Of course. Our lobby is set up for wireless, so just bring your computer down here. 
Use my laptop in the lobby? That's great! Now, if I need to print something there? 
They plan to install a printer here. But until then, you'll have to use the lab.
