[T:] I'm going to need a taxi. 
You don't have to restrict yourself to a taxi. We can offer you a private vehicle. 
A private vehicle, huh? No, a taxi is okay. 
Some people find a limo to be much more comfortable than a taxi. 
No, I wouldn't be caught dead in a limo. 
No upgrade of any kind. And where might you be going? 
I'm headed to Rockefeller Center. 
When shall I tell the taxi to be here? 
Right now. 
The taxi will be here immediately, sir. 
Good, I'm leaving my room in about one minute. 
You won't have to wait a second, sir.
