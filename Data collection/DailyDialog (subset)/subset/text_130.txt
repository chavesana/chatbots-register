[G:] Hi, I'm Josephine Chen, the tour guide for the Jade Agency. We have a reservation of twenty rooms for tonight. 
Please to meet you, Miss Chen. My name is Joey. Welcome to the hotel. Here are the keys, registration slips and breakfast vouchers. Break-fast will be served from seven tomorrow morning. Is there any change in your schedule? 
No, our check-out time will still be 8: 30 tomorrow. 
Then we will arrange a morning call at 7:30. Will that be fine? 
That's alright. 
Please put your luggage outside your room by eight. The bellboy will pick them up. 
Thank you. 
Thank you very much. Hope you enjoy your stay.
