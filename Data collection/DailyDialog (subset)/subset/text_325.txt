[T:] I'm looking for a budget hotel in Orlando. Have you ever stayed at the Comfort Hotel? 
Yes... I wouldn ’ t recommend it. 
Why not? 
Granted, it ’ s cheap, but the place is filthy, the beds are uncomfortable, there ’ s no A / C, the breakfast is pretty skimpy... and the staff couldn ’ t care less about the guests. 
Oh. I guess you get what you pay for. How long did you stay there? 
Just one night, when my flight was canceled due to bad weather. It ’ s bearable if you just need a place to crash, but you definitely don ’ t want to book a vacation there. Unless you enjoy sharing your room with cockroaches. 
Hmm, I ’ ll pass. Hopefully I can find a decent place that won ’ t cost a fortune.
