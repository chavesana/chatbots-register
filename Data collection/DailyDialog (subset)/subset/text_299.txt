[T:] Hello, miss. Can you bring me something to drink? 
Sure, sir. But there is a charge for alcoholic beverages in economy class. Would you please refer to this price list? And then give me your order. 
Thank you for reminding me. Well, please give me a glass of brandy and I will pay for it. 
OK, I will bring it to you in a moment.
