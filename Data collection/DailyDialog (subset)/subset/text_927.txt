[T:] Hello! Do you have a place where I can exercise? 
Yes, sir. We have a fine exercise facility. 
I'm happy to hear that. Now, would you tell me where it is? 
You're actually standing above it. Just take the elevator or stairs down one level. 
Is the hotel going to charge me a dollar a minute for gym use? 
No, sir. There's no extra charge. All you need is your room key to open the door. 
And the gym hours are? 
Sir, you'll be pleased to know that our gym never closes. 
One more question, Do you have a trainer? 
We might be getting one in the near future. But at the present time, no.
