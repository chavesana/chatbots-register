[G:] Next please. Hello. How can I help you? 
I'd like to buy a ticket for New York. 
Would you like one way or round trip? 
Round trip. 
When will you be leaving? 
When does the next plane leave? 
In about 2 hours. 
I'd like a ticket for that flight please. 
First class or coach? 
Coach. 
OK, let me check availability. I'm sorry. Tickets for that flight are sold out. 
How about the one after that? 
Let me see. Yes, that one still has seats available. Would you like me to reserve a seat for you? 
Yes, please. 
That'll be 120 dollars. 
OK. 
Thank you, here's your change.
