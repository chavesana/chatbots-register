[T:] I want to check out today. My plane leaves at 3 p.m. 
Which room are you staying in now, sir? 
I am in Room 205. My name is Bill Smith. When shall I check out? 
Usually if you are leaving today, you'd better check out before 12 noon, and leave the room. If you check out after 12 noon, we will count one day more. 
Oh, I didn't know that. 
Since your plane leaves at 3 p.m. it will be too early for you to leave the hotel at 12 0 ' clock. We can arrange you to stay in the room until 1 p.m. ; but first you should still check out before 12 noon. 
That's very considerate of you. May I have my bill? 
Yes, sir. Here it is. 
How much is it? 
Your bill comes to 60 dollars. How would you like it to be paid? With cash or credit card? 
I'd like it to be charged to my credit card. 
Would you please give to me, and will imprint it?
