[G:] Hello. Can I help you? 
[T:] Hello. Is my laundry ready? My room number is 210. 
[G:] I'm afraid it is still being washed. 
[T:] Can you take the stain off? 
[G:] Yes, we can. But you need wait a moment. 
[T:] That's right. Can I get it back in the afternoon? I really need them tonight. 
[G:] Yes, it will be ready then. 
[T:] OK. By the way, please get them pressed. 
[G:] No problem.
