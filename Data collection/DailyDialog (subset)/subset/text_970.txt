[G:] Good morning. What can I do for you? 
[T:] Well, I hate to disturb you, but I really can't stand it any more. Can you change my room for me? It's too noisy. I was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made. It was too much for me. 
[G:] I'm sorry to hear that. This room is at the end of the corridor. It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when everything is quiet. 
[T:] Anyhow, I'd like to change my room. 
[G:] I'm awfully sorry, Miss. I do apologize. We'll manage it, but we don't have any spare room today. Could you wait till tomorrow? A tour company will be leaving tomorrow morning. There'll be some rooms for you to choose from. 
[T:] All right. I hope I'll be able to enjoy my stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep. 
[G:] Be sure. And if there is anything more you need, please let us know. 
[T:] OK. Thank you. 
[G:] You're welcome. I hope you'll be more comfortable in your new room.
