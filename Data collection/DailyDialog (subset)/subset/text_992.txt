[T:] A single, preferably with a bath. 
[G:] How long do you intend to stay? 
[T:] For four days or so. 
[G:] We have one single room on the fifth floor.

[G:] It's very quiet, sir. 
[T:] How much does it cost per day? 
[G:] It's 150 yuan per day including a 10 % service charge. 
[T:] All right. I'll take the room.
