[T:] Where are we going now? 
[G:] We are going to Jingshan Park. Originally it was an imperial garden while it is now a public park. 
[T:] Where is it? 
[G:] It is at the north of Forbidden City, on the central axis of Beijing. 
[T:] What can we see in it? 
[G:] Jingshan consists of five individual peaks, and there lies an elaborate pavilion on the top of each peak. These pavilions were used for gathering and leisure time. These five peaks also draw the approximate historical axis of central Beijing. 
[T:] Anything else? 
[G:] According to the dictates of Eng Shut, it is favorable to site a residence to the south of a nearby hill. When the capital was moved to Beijing, no hill existed at this location, so one was constructed. It is called " Coal Hill ". The last emper-or of Ming Dynasty, Chongzhen, committed suicide by hanging himself here in 1644. 
[T:] Tragedy. 
[G:] Jingshan Park is especially a popular place for old people socializing and gathering. People can often find elder folks dancing, singing opera and other cultural activities at Jingshan Park.
