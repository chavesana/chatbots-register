[G:] New York Airport.May I help you? 
Yes. I am calling to make sure if flight CG877 will arrive on time? 
Hold on a moment please... Sorry, the flight from London has been delayed. It departed two hours later than scheduled.The whether in London was really bad. 
You mean it will arrive two hours later than usual? 
So far we could only deduce this way.If you want further information, would you please call us 1 hour later? 
OK, thank you.
