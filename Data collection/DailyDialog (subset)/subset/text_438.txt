[T:] How many ports do we call at on our passage? 
Four ports. 
The ship is going very fast. 
Perhaps she makes about 25 knots an hour. 
You look pale. Are you seasick? 
I don't feel very good. 
I have some tablets for seasickness. 
They give me no help at all. 
Then we'd better go back to our cabin.
