[G:] Welcome to our hotel's indoor swimming pool. What can I do for you? 
You see this is the first time for me to use the swimming pool. I've got no idea about the water temperature of the pool. I'm afraid it might be a little cold. 
You don't need to worry about that. madam. We have a warm massage pool, and the temperature is 36 Â° C. 
I see. But I'm not a good swimmer. Can you tell me how deep the pool is? 
Certainly, madam. The deepest place is two meters but you can swim in the shallow area, which is only l. 4 meter in depth. We have separate locker rooms over there and they are free of charge. 
That's great! Can you give me the key to the locker? I can't wait to have a try.
