[G:] Good morning, can I help you? 
Yes, I'd like to check out. 
Yes, of course sir. What's your name and your room number, PLS? 
Jack Remington, room 1408. 
Ok, here is your bill, Mr. Remington. 
Which of these is my bill? 
Oh, I am sorry sir. I forgot to explain that to you. This one is an allowance slip. We made a mistake in your bill and overcharged you 120 dollars. So we had to write up an allowance slip and deduct 120 dollars from your bill. 
I see. So this is the bill then and the total is...? 
Down here, 800 dollars. How do you wish to settle your account, sir, in cash or by credit card? 
In cash. 
Is that US dollars? 
Yes. 
Just a moment, PLS. I'll write out a receipt for you.
