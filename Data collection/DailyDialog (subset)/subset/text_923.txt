[T:] I want to change rooms. In fact, I want a refund for tonight! 
If you tell me the exact problem, I can be more helpful. 
Cockroaches have declared war on my room! 
Allow me to apologize. I'll give you another room right now, and a full refund for tonight. 
Thank you for not asking me to collect the roaches in a jar as evidence. 
Sir, only your mother wants to please you more than we do.
