[T:] I've got a reservation here. My name is John Sandals. 
Mr. Sandals, may I see your ID, please? 
One second, please, while I dig it out. Here. 
Now, sir, do you have a credit card? 
Yes, I do. Do you accept American Express? 
I'm sorry, Mr. Sandals, but we accept only MasterCard or VISA. 
That's okay, I've got plenty of cards. Here's my VISA. 
Okay. You're in room 507. It's a single queen-size bed, spacious, and nonsmoking. Is that suitable? 
Yes, that's just what I wanted. 
Here's your key, sir. If you need anything, just dial 0 on your room phone.
