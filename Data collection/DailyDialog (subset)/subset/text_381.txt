[G: Good morning, sir. Can I help you? 
I'm due to check out tomorrow, but I'd like to extend my stay by two days. 
Could I have your name and room number? 
Tom Black in Room 207. 
Please wait a moment, Mr. Black. I'll have to check the reservation records... I'm sorry, but we are expecting several tour groups to arrive today. They have booked all the rooms on the 10th floor. 
What can be done then? 
If you don't mind transferring to another room, we may manage it for you. We usually have cancellations or no-shows. 
That's quite all right. Thank you. 
It's my pleasure.
