[T:] This room is unfit for humans. I want another room, and I want a refund for tonight. 
Perhaps if you would be kind enough to tell me the problem, sir. 
In a word, cockroaches! 
Oh, no, are they back? I'll give you another room immediately, sir, and a refund for tonight. 
Thank you. I'm glad that you don't believe that your guests are liars. 
Sir, without happy guests, we are nothing.
