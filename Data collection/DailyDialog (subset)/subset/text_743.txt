[T:] I'm taking a date to a restaurant, so could you please direct me to a good one? 
But of course! How much are you thinking of spending on dinner? 
She deserves nothing but the best, of course. 
In that case, I would suggest our own hotel restaurant. The chef, the food, and the service are outstanding. 
I promised her I would take her out to a restaurant. Do you have another one in mind? 
You can always go to Gramercy Tavern. It's quite popular, despite its expensive entrees. 
Great food and lots of patrons? What more could I want? Please reserve a table for me. 
Yes, sir. You're going to have a great time.
