[T:] That is a long line. 
[G:] Yes indeed. It has a very strict inspection so it takes a pretty long Be for everyone. 
[T:] A lot of things are prohibited to take on the plane? 
[G:] Yes, a lot. Stuffs which are explosive, radioactive and poisonous are forbidden. 
[T:] Understand. Do I need to take out my laptop from my suitcase? 
[G:] Yes, you do. And you need to put out liquid items and your laptop in the box for inspection. 
[T:] That is really strict. 
[G:] Yes, absolutely. But this is for everyone's sake, so we should do it as needed.
