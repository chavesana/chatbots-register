[T:] Excuse me. Is this the right way to the museum? 
I'm afraid you're going in the opposite direction. Go back the way you came, and take the second turn on the left. The museum is straight ahead, right in front of you. 
Will it take me long to get there? 
Well, it's about fifteen minutes ' walk. 
Which bus goes there? 
You may take a No. 34 bus. And the subway can also take you there. 
Thank you very much. 
My pleasure.
