[G:] There's been a dramatic change in the weather pattern. 
[T:] Don't tell me it affects our flight. 
[G:] It has been delayed. 
[T:] Did they say for how long? 
[G:] No, but probably until there is a break in the storm. 
[T:] So we can't really go anywhere, can we? 
[G:] I think it's smart to stay close to the gate so we can hear the updates. 
[T:] I brought some cards. Are you up for a long game?
