[T:] Excuse me. Do you happen to have a gym here? 
Yes, sir. I think you'll find our gym quite satisfactory. 
So, where do I go to exercise? 
It's only one flight down, sir. Just take the elevator or the stairs. 
Am I going to be charged extra for using the gym? 
Sir, you can use the gym for free. All you need is your room key. 
Great! Now tell me, what are the hours of this gym? 
Sir, our gym is open around the clock, every day of the week. 
Okay. Do you have a trainer to help me work out? 
I'm sorry, sir, but we have no trainer.
