[T:] Hello, hot water overflowed from the bathtub. Would you help me? 
Would you turn off the tap? 
I did it. 
Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door. 
Ok, I will. 
I will have our housekeeper come right away. 
I am sorry, I was too tired to fall asleep. 
When you woke up, the water was coming out the tub? 
Right. Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance?
