[T:] Is this the front desk? 
[G:] Yes, sir. What can I do for you? 
[T:] This is Room 705. The air conditioner in my room doesn't work. 
[G:] I'll have that taken care of immediately. 
[T:] And may I have two more towels, please? 
[G:] No problem. We'll bring you the towels in just a minute. 
[T:] Thanks.
