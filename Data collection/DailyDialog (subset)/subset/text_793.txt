[T:] I still have a question to ask you. 
[G:] It's my pleasure! 
[T:] How much luggage can I take for my flight? 
[G:] It is allowed to carry 55 pounds for each passenger. 
[T:] But if I have more than 55 pounds, what can I do? 
[G:] You will have to pay some for every extra pound. 
[T:] How about my hand carry luggage? 
[G:] You can bring one, if you want to.
