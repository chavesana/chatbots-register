[T:] I am sorry to trouble you, but there's a lot of noise in the next room. 
Oh, is there? Which room is it? 
It's. I think, neighbours on the right. 
You mean the room thirteen-thirteen? 
I'm not sure, but I think so. I'm very exhausted, but I can't sleep. 
All right, ma'am. I'll check and tell them to be quiet. 
If next room is still noisy, could you give me a different room, please?
