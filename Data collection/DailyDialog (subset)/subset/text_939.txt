[T:] Excuse me, could you tell me whether there is a restaurant near here? 
[G:] Yes, there is one at Sanyuan Bridge. It is a famous restaurant in the city. 
[T:] I'm afraid there must be a lot of people there. 
[G:] I think so. I think you'd better make a phone call to see whether there is a table available. 
[T:] But we don't know the telephone number. 
[G:] Here is a tourist guidebook. You can look it up in the book. 
[T:] You are so kind! Thank you very much. 
[G:] It's a pleasure.
