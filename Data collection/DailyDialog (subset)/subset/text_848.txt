[G:] Can I help you, sir? 
Yes, I'm checking out. 
Can I have your key and room number, please? 
Room 1419. Here's my key. 
Here's your bill, sir. Could you please check it? 
It's all right. Please charge it to my credit card. 
Here you are, sir. You're all set. I hope you enjoyed your stay. And that next time you're in town, you will stay with us again. 
I will. Where can I leave my luggage? I really want to leave after lunch. 
The bell captain will put it in the storage room. When you're ready to leave, you can claim your luggage from him. 
Thanks very much. And good-bye.
