[T:] Here is my ticket and seat assignment. 
Thank you. That way, PLS. 
May I have a pillow and blanket, PLS? 
An attendant will pass them around after we take off. 
May I have headphones for the in-flight movie? 
No problem. Here are your headphones. Do you want something to drink? 
Thanks, a coke, PLS.
