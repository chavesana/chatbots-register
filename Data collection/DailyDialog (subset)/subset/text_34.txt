[T:] I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights? 
I'm very sorry, sir. I could put you on a waiting list, but you would be wise to check out other means of travel. 
You mean like a bus? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before? 
I have not sir. But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here. 
Alright, give me the number. But put me on that waiting list as well. 
Here is the number, and your name is on the waiting list. 
How many people are on the waiting list right now? 
Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list. And you are number 176.
