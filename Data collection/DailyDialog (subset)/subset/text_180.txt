[T:] Is this the right counter to check in for this flight? 
Yes, it is. Please put your luggage on the scale. 
Your luggage is overweight. The free allowance for luggage is 20 kilos. 
Oh, can I keep this little suitcase as hand-luggage? 
OK, in this way it's just below the limit. 
Here's your ticket and your boarding card. 
All right. I will begin boarding soon.
