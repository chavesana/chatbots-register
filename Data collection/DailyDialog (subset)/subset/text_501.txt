[G:] Housekeeping. May I help you? 
Yes. This is room 804. I can't find my coat. I was wondering if it's in the lost and found. 
I can check for you. Could you describe the coat? 
It's a light blue coat. It's got a hood and a big silver zipper. 
When was the last time you saw it? 
Last night. I think I may have left it in the lobby bar. 
OK. I â€™ ll check the lost and found and with the bar manager. We'll do our best to find it. 
Thanks. I appreciate that.
