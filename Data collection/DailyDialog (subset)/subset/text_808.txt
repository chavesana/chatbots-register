[T:] I am sorry to say this, but I seem to have lost the key to the safe. 
Where do you think you lost it? Outside the hotel? 
Yes, I believe so.How should I compensate for this? 
I'm afraid, ma'am, you have to pay U. S. $100 since you lost the key. 
What! One hundred U. S. dollars.Is it covered by the insurance? 
I'm afraid no.It is not covered by this insurance.
