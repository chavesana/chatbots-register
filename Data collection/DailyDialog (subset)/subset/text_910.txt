[T:] I'm quite upset! I want a new room and a refund for tonight. 
Forgive me, sir, I haven't been told what the problem is. 
I'm about to be swept away by millions of cockroaches! 
My apologies, sir. We'll transfer you to a new room at once and give you a full refund. 
Thank you. I didn't want to have to take this to court. 
Sir, we never want a guest to stay here mad or unhappy.
