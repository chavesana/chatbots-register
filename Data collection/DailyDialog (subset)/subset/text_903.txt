[T:] I have a little problem with room 507. 
What exactly seems to be the problem, Mr. Sandals? 
I found cockroaches in my room. 
Cockroaches, sir? That's unbelievable. 
I've seen at least nine different cockroaches in my room. 
Sir, are you sure you haven't seen the same silverfish nine times? 
There are nine cockroaches in my room. I don't have time for your disbelief! 
I apologize. One moment, please, while I transfer you to my supervisor.
