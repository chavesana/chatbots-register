[G:] May I see your airplane ticket, passport and health certificate please? 
Here you are. 
Will you please put your luggage on the scale? 
I want to check these three pieces and I'll carry this overnight bag by myself. 
Sir, your bags are 30 pounds over weight. You are allowed only 45 pounds of baggage. 
Well, then, how much do I owe you? 
That comes to H. K. $120.
