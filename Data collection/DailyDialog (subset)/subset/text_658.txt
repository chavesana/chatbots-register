[G:] John, I'm sorry, the air tickets for the International Day are sold out. 
Really? I didn't expect that. 
It's possible because everyone wants to travel during the holiday weekend. 
I should have booked the tickets in advance. 
Take it easy. I'll like you know if anyone decides to cancel his reservation.
