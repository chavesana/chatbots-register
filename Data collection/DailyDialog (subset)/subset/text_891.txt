[T:] I made a reservation earlier this week, but I have to cancel it. 
No problem, sir. Just tell me your name, phone number, and date of reservation. 
Great! I'm Rudy Randolph, 818-555-1234, and my reservation was for April 9 to 15. 
Okay, sir, let me hit the delete button, and your reservation will be cancelled. 
That was nice and fast. Thanks. 
Not at all.
