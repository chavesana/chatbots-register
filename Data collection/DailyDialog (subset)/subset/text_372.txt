[T:] Can I have a look at your international timetable? 
Sorry.We don't have a printed one. Is there anything else I can do for you? 
Yes. Do you have any direct flight to Tokyo? 
Sorry, we don't. I don't think you can find any airline which offers a non-stop flight to Tokyo. 
What about a flight to Paris? 
Yes. It is really a place of interest and we have the direct flight everyday.
