[T:] Hello, I am Mr. Johnson at room 309. I would like to have a safe box. Do I need to pay for a safe box? 
[G:] No, you don't. Just fill out this card and sign your name and room number on it. 
[T:] Here you are. Can I have a larger envelope to put my valuable things in it? 
[G:] Yes, will this do? 
[T:] Yes, it's perfect. 
[G:] Wait a minute. This is your safe box key, don't lose it. You'll have to pay two thousand yuan if you lose the key. 
[T:] OK, I won't.
