[T:] Why am I being charged $10 for a movie that I never ordered? 
Sir, according to your file, you spent Monday evening watching ' Titanic. ' 
Well, the file is wrong. I was at a great concert that night. 
Well, this wouldn't be the first time that a file was wrong. Just a moment, please. 
Thank you for taking care of it so quickly. 
Sir, when I deleted the $10, the program automatically added a $2 service charge. 
You can't do that! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made! 
Sometimes you can't win for losing, sir. 
Well, now I've seen it all! What a rip-off this place is! 
I don't blame you, sir. Two dollars is a lot of money.
