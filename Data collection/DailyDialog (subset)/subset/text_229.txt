[T:] Excuse me, sir. I can't find my baggage. Here is my claim tag. 
Don't worry, madam. Can you make a description of your baggage? 
One is a small-size Nike in red and the other is a big one in black. The two are tied together. 
OK. We will make an announcement for you. Please leave your telephone number, we will call your as soon as we have your baggage.
