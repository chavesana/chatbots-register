[G:] Well, sir. We are asking all our guests to wear a jacket and a tie in our restaurant. 
Is that so? I didn't know it. can I possibly borrow a jacket and a tie? 
I am sorry ; you can't borrow a jacket and a tie. 
Then we'll return to the hotel and come back, will you change the appointment? 
Certainly, what time will you come back? 
At 7, please. 
How many in your party? 
A party of 13. 
Alright, we are waiting for you at 7.
