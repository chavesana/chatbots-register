[G:] Ladies and gentlemen, we are heading towards the first spot of our trip-the Louvre. 
[T:] Wonderful. That's a place famous for its arts. 
[G:] Yes. There are so many famous paintings on show. I am sure it will be an unforgettable trip. 
[T:] Surely it will be. By the way, when will we get there? 
[G:] Half an hours later.
