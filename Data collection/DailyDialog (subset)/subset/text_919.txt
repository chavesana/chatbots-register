[T:] I'd like to order broadband internet for my laptop. 
Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and a prompt will tell you the payment options. 
Well, I don't have an Ethernet port. My computer runs entirely on wireless service. 
That's too bad. But there are several alternatives, if you want to hear them. 
Yes, please! Tell me about the alternatives. 
We run a fully equipped computer lab on the first floor. 
Very good. How much does that cost? 
The service is free to hotel patrons. However, printing costs ten cents per page. 
I see. And the other alternatives? 
Alternatively, we do offer wireless in our lobby. You can bring your laptop down here. 
Great! What if I need to print something in the lobby? 
You would have to use the computer lab. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
