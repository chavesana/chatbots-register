[T:] Hi there, I want to reserve a hotel room. 
No problem at all. Could I have your full name, please? 
Sure, John Sandals. 
Hi, Mr. Sandals. I'm Michelle, at your service. When do you need the room? 
My plans are to be there April 14th to the 17th. 
We have new room rates, sir. Will that be acceptable to you? 
Well, it depends on the price, of course. What is it? 
It's $308 a night. 
I have no problem with that. 
Great! Would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking? 
Definitely nonsmoking. I can't handle that smell. 
Nonsmoking. Now, is a queen-size bed okay? 
No problem. 
Great, Mr. Sandals. Your reservation is confirmed. Now all I need is your phone number. 
Of course! It's area code 626-555-1739. 
Thank you so much, Mr. Sandals. We look forward to seeing you!
