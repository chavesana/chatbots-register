[T:] Hello, it's my first time in Egypt. What would you advise me to see here? 
[G:] There are many famous resorts in Egypt. You can have a good time here. 
[T:] But I'm going to stay here only for two days. 
[G:] I'm afraid two days isn't enough for you to see all the places of interest. 
[T:] What shall I do then? 
[G:] If I were you, the pyramid would be my first choice. It's so magnificent. 
[T:] It's really worth seeing. By the way, I'd like to buy some souvenirs. 
[G:] You needn't worry about it. There are many stores at the scenic spots. I'm sure you can get what you want. 
[T:] OK. I know what to do now. Thank you.
