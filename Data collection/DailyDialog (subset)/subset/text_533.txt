[T:] Excuse me, this is my first time on a plane. How do I check in? 
May I see your ticket, please? 
Yes. Here you are. 
You can get a boarding pass at that counter. Do you have anything to check in? 
No, I only have a handbag. 
Then you could wait in the departure area after going through security. 
Is that all? 
Yeah, I think so. It is very simple. 
I see. Thank you very much.
