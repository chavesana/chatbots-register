[G:] Good morning, sir. May I help you? 
Yes, I'd like to settle my bill. 
Certainly sir. May I have your room key, please? 
Sure. Here you are. 
Just a moment, please. I'll draw up your bill for you... Thank you for waiting, sir. Your bill totals two thousand six hundred and fifty-eight yuan, including the phone and laundry. 
That much! Would you mind letting me have a look at it? 
Not at all, sir. Here you are. 
Thanks. Well, It seems to be right. How much is that in dollars, please? 
Just a moment, sir. I'll calculate that for you. It comes to 305 dollars and 52 cents at today's exchange rate. 
I see. OK. 
How would you like to make the payment? 
In cash, please. Here you are. 
Thank you, sir... Here is your change. Could you check it, please? Thank you for choosing our hotel. I hope you enjoyed your stay. 
By the way, please forward my mail to this address. 
Certainly, sir. We hope you have a good trip.
