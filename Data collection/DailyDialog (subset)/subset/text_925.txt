[T:] Pardon me. Does your hotel have a fitness facility? 
Yes, sir. We try to anticipate all our guests ' needs, including fitness. 
Great! Where is it? 
Sir, the gym is just below the lobby. You can take the elevator or the stairs. 
Do I have to pay extra? 
No, sir. It's gratis. Just take your room key so you can get in. 
What are the gym hours? 
You'll be happy to know that it's open 24/7. 
Great! Is a trainer available? 
I'm sorry, but no. We used to have a trainer, but then he had an unfortunate accident.
