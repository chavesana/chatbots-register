[T:] My wife is sick, so I have to cancel a reservation I made. 
If you'll just give me your name, phone, and date of visit, I can cancel your reservation. 
I'm Rudy Randolph at 818-555-1234, April ninth to the fifteenth. 
Mr. Randolph. Okay, one second, sir, and there you go. Your reservation is now cancelled. 
I wish everything in life was so simple. Thank you. 
Not a problem, sir. Please remember us in the future.
