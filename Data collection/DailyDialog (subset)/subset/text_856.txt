[T:] I'd like to check in, PLS. 
Awfully sorry, sir. There are no rooms available now. 
But I â€™ Ve reserved a room the day before yesterday. 
Sorry, may I have your name? 
Tony Bush. 
Pls wait a minute, let me check. Excuse me, but I can't seem to find your name on our list. Are you sure you have a reservation for tonight? 
Of course, I did it myself. 
I am terribly sorry. There must have been some mistakes. Let me check it again. Oh, yes, there is a name listed as Tommy Bush. It must be the fault of the clerk who registered your name. I apologize. 
Don't worry about that. 
According to the records, your reservation is for a single room with shower and air conditioners for two nights. The room rate will be 110 dollars per night, including 10 % tax and 4 % service charge. Is this right? 
Yes, that's right. I'd like to pay my bill by credit card. 
May I make a copy of your card? 
Here you are. 
Ok, now could you fill out this registration form? 
All right. 
Your room number is 707. Here is your key. The bellhop will help you carry the suitcases to your room. Have a nice evening!
