[T:] I'd like to order a restock on my minibar. 
You finished everything in there, sir? 
Absolutely everything. 
What would you like to order? 
Three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam. 
Uh-huh. What else do you want? 
The apples were great. Could you bring a couple more up? 
No problem. Is there anything else I can get for you? 
Some grape juice would also be nice. 
I'll get all of that for you right away. Someone should be up shortly
