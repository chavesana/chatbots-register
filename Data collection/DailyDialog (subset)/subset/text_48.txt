[T:] Good idea! I've heard that the Expo is doing pretty well now, and ads are seen everywhere in the country on all means of media, newspapers, TV, street signs, etc. 
[G:] Yeah, it's the last world-wide horti-cultural exposition in the century, and one of the grand festivities of cross-century significance held by the China's tourism industry. 
[T:] what's interesting to see there? 
[G:] Oh, there's plenty. Flowers and plants from all over the world, of course. Besides, gardening techniques are demonstrated, modern facilities displayed, academic exchanges and seminars organized, and folk performances of different nations shown almost every day. 
[T:] I visited the First International Flower Festival in the city last year, and was impressed with so many beautiful flowers! 
[G:] Oh, can't compare with the Kunming Expo at all! The Kunming Expo covers an area of 218 hectares, and more than 9000 flower enterprises from over 100 countries and regions are invited to participate in the Expo. 
[T:] It would be a rare occasion to be able to appreciate so many fine species of Chinese and foreign flowers fully blooming in one park! 
[G:] Far more than that, I dare to say! Inland provinces and cities, Hong Kong and Macao, as well as many countries and regions in the world have an exhibition area of their own to display their unique flowers and plants. Each month there's a special day for a particular country or region, and folk performances are given. You will feel it a great pity if you missile Kunming Expo.
