[G:] Passport, please! 
Here you are. 
Are you Chinese? 
Yes, I am. 
Where in China are you from? 
Fujisan Province. 
There are a lot of people from China visiting right now. 
It's not surprising. Our school year just ended, and a lot of Chinese are on vacation.

About half a month. 
All right. Here's your passport. Welcome to Australia. 
Thank you.
