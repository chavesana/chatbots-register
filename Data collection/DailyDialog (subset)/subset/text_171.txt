[G:] Beijing Hotel. May I help you? 
Yes. I'd like to book a double room with bath. 
For what time, sir? 
I plan to arrive on August fifth and leave on August eighth. 
From August fifth to eighth. Just a moment. Yes, we have a vacancy for that period. What's your name, please? 
Li Gang. 
That's OK, Mr. Li, a double room with bath from the fifth of August to the eighth. 
That's right. 
By the way, how do you like to pay for it? This hotel prefers cash. 
I see. When can I receive your confirmation? 
Not until you have paid 10 percent margin. 
I'll log in to the Internet to know about you. I know your address. 
Thank you. Bye.
