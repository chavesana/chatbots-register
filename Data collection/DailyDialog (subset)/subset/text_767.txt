[G:] Good afternoon! Trans Pacific Airline. How can I help you? 
I ’ m calling to cancel my reservation for Trans Pacific Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis. Could you please make it for the same flight on August 2 instead of July 19? 
What ’ s your name, please? 
My name is Judy Wang. 
How do you spell your name, please? 
My first name is J-U-D-Y, and my last name is W-A-N-G. 
Please note that this ticket has a penalty of $75 for any change or cancellation. 
It ’ s OK. Where should I pay for the penalty? 
At the airport. OK, Miss. Wang, your Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis is canceled. Your new reservation is Trans Pacific Flight 8 from Taipei to Minneapolis at 9 thirty a.m. on August 2. 
That ’ s 1POJ7403. 
That ’ s correct. 
Thank you! 
Is there anything else I can do for you? 
No, thanks. I ’ m all set. Good-bye.
