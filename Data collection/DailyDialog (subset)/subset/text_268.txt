[T:] Is this the right counter to check in for this flight? 
Can I have a look at your ticket? 
Here you are. I have just come from downtown. 
I am sorry.sir.Your plane has just taken off. 
Really? What can I do now? I can't miss the important meeting. 
I am so sorry to hear that. Maybe you should go to the information counter over there. They can give you some advice.
