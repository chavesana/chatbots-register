[G:] Hello! This is Air China Booking Office. 
Hello! I'd like to reconfirm my flight reservation. 
May I know your flight number, please? 
It's flight CA169, which leaves Beijing at 8: 00 a.m. on January 20th. 
Oh, yes. That's our regular flight to Nanchang. Would you please tell me your name? 
My name is Deng Li. 
Yes, here you are. You're flying in economy class. Is that right? 
Oh, no. I'm sure I made a reservation for a first-class ticket. 
Let me check. Now, your ticket is in order. Thank you for calling to reconfirm. 
That's what I should do. And I don't want to lose it. 
Quite right. If you don't confirm, the reservation will be cancelled 72 hours before the departure time. In order not to miss your flight, I think you should pick up your ticket as early as possible. 
OK! I shall.
