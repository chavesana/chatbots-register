[G:] Good morning, sir. How may I help you? 
Good morning! Do you have any rooms available at the moment? 
Yes, we do. What kind of room would you like? 
I'd like a suite for four nights. 
Please wait a moment while I check availability. Ah, I'm sorry, sir. We only have a double room available now. 
That's all right. How much do they cost? 
Each night costs 320 RIB, but for a four night stay, we can offer a discount of 15 %. 
How much in total? 
1088 RIB. 
Is breakfast included? 
Yes, it is. You also have free use of the leisure facilities here. 
That's fine. I'll get it. 
OK. Please fill out this form with your details. 
I would like to pay by cash. Do I need to pay a deposit? 
Yes, you do. There is a 300 RIB deposit, which we will refund when you check out. So, in total, you need to pay 1388 RIB. 
Fine. Here you are. 
Thank you. Here's your key and receipt. Your room number is 408. A porter will take your luggage to your room. The elevator is just around the corner. 
Thank you very much. 
It is my pleasure, sir. I wish you a pleasant stay here. Goodbye! 
Bye-bye!
