[T:] Excuse me. We're leaving today. I'd like to pay our bills now. 
OK. By the way, I'd like to tell you that the check-out time is 12 
I see. 
Have you used any hotel services this morning or had breakfast at the hotel dining room, Mr. Green? 
Yes, my friend and I just had breakfast at the dining room, but we didn't use any services. 
How about the charge for the days you shared the room with your friend? 
Please add to my account. 
The total for the eight days is five hundred sixty yuan. 
OK. Here you are.
