[G:] Do you have anything to declare? 
I have a camera and three bottles of whisky. 
OK. You'll have to pay duty for the whisky. 
Well, where shall I pay the duty for the whisky? 
Please wait a moment. I'll make out the duty memo. Here you are. Take this and pay the people over there. 
I've paid the duty. Here is the receipt 
Very well. I hope you'll enjoy your stay in China. 
Thank you.
