[T:] I'll be checking out of the hotel in about 30 minutes. 
Thirty minutes or 30 seconds, sir, it doesn't matter, I'm ready for you. 
Great! As you know, however, the day in New York has hardly begun. 
There's nothing like getting an early start, sir. 
What can I do with my baggage while I visit a few more tourist spots? 
You can leave your baggage in our storage space, with a deposit. 
Isn't my baggage enough of a deposit? 
I wish it was, but it isn't. They will still want a credit card. 
It's always something, isn't it? Let me think about this for a second. 
Don't forget that you have very little time, sir, before you have to check out.
