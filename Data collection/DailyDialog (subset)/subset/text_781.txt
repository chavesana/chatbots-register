[T:] I would like to know is it a direct flight to Dubai? 
[G:] Sorry. No. You need to transfer to a connect flight in the middle. 
[T:] Too bad. I hate transferring during a flight. It is too complex. 
[G:] You have to do it. But it takes only about 30 minutes. 
[T:] Really? It used to cost a few hours. 
[G:] It has become more time saving. 
[T:] Ok. Good. I want two side by side tickets in the Economy cabinet. Thank you.
