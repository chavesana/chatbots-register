[G:] Ladies and gentlemen, now we are in the National Forest Park. 
[T:] What's that? 
[G:] The stone is a prehistoric log. It was turned to stone millions of years ago. 
[T:] Really? It's unbelievable. 
[G:] But it's the truth. 
[T:] Do you have Ginkgo trees here? 
[G:] We don't have them here, I'm afraid. Ginkgo trees grow well only in cold weather. 
[T:] What are these trees opposite to the pine trees? 
[G:] They are poplar trees. They are widely used in our lives. 
[T:] I think I know that.
