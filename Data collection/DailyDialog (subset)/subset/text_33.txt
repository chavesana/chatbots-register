[G:] Let's go over this plan again. 
From Vancouver, we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg. 
And that is mostly flat, right? 
Relatively, once we're out of Alberta, anyway. Then it's hills again in Aitoba. 
And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto, right? 
That's right. And up in to Quebec. And that's where we stop. 
It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long, long ride. 
Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime?
