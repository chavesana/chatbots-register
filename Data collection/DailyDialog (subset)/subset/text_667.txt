[G:] Hello. This is the Holiday Inn. Can I help you? 
Hi. Is there a special rate for a group reservation? 
Yes. There is a 20 % to 40 % discount. It depends on the season.During the summer the discount is 20 %. During the winter it is 40 %. 
I need five single rooms in October. How much of a discount can I get? 
Our summer season ended in September. So the discount will be 40 %. That ’ s a good deal. Would you prefer rooms with a front view or rear view? 
Front view, please. 
What date and time will you be checking in? 
October 25th around 2:00 in the afternoon. 
We need you to send a deposit for 1/3 of the bill. You can send the check, or you can use the credit card. 
Ok. I ’ ll send a check. 
Could you tell me your name, address and phone number, please? 
Sure. My name is Anderson. My address is 109 Ferguson East, Holton. And my phone number is 309 789 1267. 
Thanks.
