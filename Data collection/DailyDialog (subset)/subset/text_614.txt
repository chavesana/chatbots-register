[T:] Could I see the manager please? I have a complaint to make. 
Yes, I ’ m the manager here. What can I do for you, Madam? 
Did you have the room checked before we move in? 
Which room are you in? 
1808. The toilet doesn ’ t work properly. The water doesn ’ t run in the shower. 
I ’ m awfully sorry to hear that. ( After checking ) I ’ ll turn to it right away. I do apologize. We ’ ll change your room to 2002. 
That ’ s not bad. Thanks for your help. 
It ’ s my pleasure, Madam.
