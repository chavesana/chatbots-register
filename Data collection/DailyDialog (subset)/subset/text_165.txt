[T:] Excuse me, Miss. I feel like vomiting. Can I bother you for some ice water, please? 
Sure, sir. But can I suggest a cup of warm water instead, I think it may help settle your stomach down. 
Fine, please. 
You can find an airsick bag in the seat pocket in front of you. 
Thank you very much for your kindness. 
You are welcome. I'll be back with the warm water in a minute.
