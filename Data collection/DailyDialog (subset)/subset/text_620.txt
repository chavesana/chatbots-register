[T:] Do you think we should travel by bus or by train? 
It ’ s a difficult choice. The train is a litter faster, but much more expensive. 
We could face delays if we travel by bus, thanks to traffic jams. 
Buses are more cramped and you can ’ t walk around. 
That ’ s true, but I feel that I see more when I travel by bus. 
Really? I think you see more traveling by train. 
So, which form of transport do you prefer to use? 
I prefer going by train, ever though it costs more. 
Ok them. We ’ ll go by train. I ’ m sure we ’ ll have a good journey. Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets? 
The train aren ’ t usually full. We can get them on the day we travel. We should buy return ticket because they are much cheaper than getting two singles. 
We should take a packed lunch on the journey. The food they sell on the trains is always expensive.
