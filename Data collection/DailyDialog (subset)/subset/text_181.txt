[G:] Good morning, welcome aboard. 
Good morning. Can I use my cellular phone during this time? 
Yes, you can use your cell phone during the boarding process until the aircraft door is closed. 
Thank you. What should I do if I want to phone my family during the flight? 
The aircraft is equipped with onboard phones. They do not interfere with the communication and navigation of the aircraft. 
So I can use the onboard phone during the flight? 
Of course. They will be used at anytime before or during flight.
