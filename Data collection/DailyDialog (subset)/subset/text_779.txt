[G:] Hmm. Let me try something.Wait. I have a reservation for someone named Sang here. But it's spelled J - A - N - G. It's not spelled J - I - A - N - G. It's for a Mr. C Sang. 
Oh, that must be me! Probably they typed the name wrong.My husband's English isn't so good. 
Yes, sometimes it happens, Ma'am. That's why it is always good to carry your confirmation number. I'm sorry about the inconvenience. 
It's okay. It's probably my husband's fault.Is there a pool in this hotel? 
Yes, of course.The pool is open until 10:00 p.m. So you still have about 45 minutes. 
Good. 
Here is your key. Your room is 379.You can find the elevators just around that corner there, down the hall.Enjoy your stay, Ma'am. 
Thank you.
