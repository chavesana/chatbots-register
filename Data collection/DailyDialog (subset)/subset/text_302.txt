[G:] Ladies and gentlemen. It's about time to land in New York. Here are a couple of forms for you to fill out. 
What forms must we fill out, Miss? 
They are E / D cards. All passengers except American citizens must complete these forms. 
I see. But why do we have to fill out these forms now? 
It will save you much time when you clear customs.
