[T:] Excuse me, but I'm not feeling too well. I think I'm going to throw up. 
There's an airsickness bag behind the seat that's in front of you. 
I must've missed it. 
Is this your first time flying? 
Yes. I'm going to San Francisco. 
Oh, it's a beautiful city. I think you'll like it. 
Hey, I'm feeling much better already. 
Sometimes if you don't think about it, that sick feeling will go away on its own. 
Thanks. By the way, my name is Mary. 
I'm Frank. Nice to meet you.
