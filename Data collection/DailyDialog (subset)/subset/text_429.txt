[G:] Good afternoon. Can I help you? 
I'd like to leave this bag with you. 
OK, sir. Is there anything valuable or breakable in it? 
Well... there is a necklace in it. 
Would you mind taking the necklace with you, or leaving it at the safe deposit box? 
Well, don't bother. I'll take it with me. Will that be all right? 
Thank you, sir. Here is your tag. This cloakroom is open till 11:00 p.m., could you pick it up by then? 
Sure. thank you.
