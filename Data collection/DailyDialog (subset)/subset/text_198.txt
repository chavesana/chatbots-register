[G:] Excuse me, but please empty your pockets of all the metal things and put them in this tray. 
Including my keys? 
Yes, and please step over there. 
All right. What shall I do now? 
Just open your bags so we can check them. After that you can pick them up right behind that X-ray machine. 
I've got film in my bag. 
That's all right. This machine will not damage the film. 
That's fine. 
Can I have your boarding pass? We need to stamp it. 
Sure. Here you are. 
Thank you. 
Am I through now? 
Yes. Here is your boarding pass. 
Thank you and goodbye.
