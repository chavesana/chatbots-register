[G:] Now we arrive at the Cambridge University, it is one of the oldest universities in the world. 
I wish I had studied here. It's more than a university. 
In 2009 Cambridge will come to its eight hundredth anniversary. 
Woo. It has such a long history. I think I should take more photos of the university.
