[G:] Excuse me! Are you Bart Simpson from Western Electronics? 
Yes, I am. 
I am Steven. I am here to meet you. 
Thank you for meeting me at the airport, Steven. 
You must be tired after the long flight. Let me carry the bags for you. 
Thanks. Where is our car? 
Our car is in the parking lot. We've booked a room for you. I will take you to the hotel soon. Let's go. 
OK. Let's go.
