[T:] Well, we didn't ask for this room service maybe someone else ask it, I â€™ m sure. 
Oh, is it? Let me check. 
Yes, please. 
I'm sorry to say this room charge is yours. 
We paid for the room service already in our room. 
Do you have any evidences? 
No, we got no receipt, and we pay it on the spot!
