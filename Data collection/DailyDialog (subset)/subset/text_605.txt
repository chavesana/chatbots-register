[T:] Where did you get all these barney tour pamphlets? 
I took them from a travel agency. Look at those nice pictures, lash forest, palm fringed, white sand beaches, crystal blue ocean, they ’ re breath-taking. It is like paradise on earth. 
That ’ s why it ’ s become a very popular holiday destination these years. Someone told me the service there is very good too. Are you planning to spend the holiday there? 
Yes, I ’ m thinking about signing up for a tour in the travel agency. Their next tour starts the same time as my holiday does next month. 
How many days is the tour? 
10 days. When I get back, I still have two days to go before work. Isn ’ t that great? 
That ’ s a perfect plan. Enjoy yourself.
