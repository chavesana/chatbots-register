[T:] Hello, who is speaking, please? 
Hello, Mr. Stern. This is Hao Bo from the International Travel Agency. I have made the plane reservations for you. 
Oh, good. Let me get a pencil and take down the information. Well, go ahead, please. 
Okay. You'll be travelling on Northwest Airlines, flight number 222. 
What time does it leave? 
It departs Guangzhou at 10:30 on the morning of July 10. 
That is good. 
You want to fly first class. Is that correct, Mr. Stern? 
That's right. 
Well, I have got you three first class tickets and I have reserved your seats. Your seat numbers are 8A, 8B and 8C. 
Those are in the non-smoking section, aren't they? 
Yes, they are. I have charged the tickets to your credit card. They are 630 dollars each, so It is 1890 dollars for all three. 
Fine, thank you very much. 
One more thing. Could you give me the names of the people you'll be travelling with? 
Sure. They are my kids, Alex and Kathy Stern. 
All right. You're all set. Have a nice flight. 
Thanks.
