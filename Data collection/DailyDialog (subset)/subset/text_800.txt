[G:] Look, George, There's the Great Wall. 
I see. It's on top of the hills. 
Yeah, it stretches over for thousands of miles. 
I know. It's a major symbol of China. 
Where can we climb it? 
Do we have any choices? 
Well, we could take the cable car. 
Ah... let's just climb. It's more fun, I think. 
Okay. Let's go. 
Well, that was tough. 
But we made it. 
This looks great. When was it built? 
It was first built about twenty-five hundred years ago. 
That's remarkable. 
There are so many ancient relics in China.
