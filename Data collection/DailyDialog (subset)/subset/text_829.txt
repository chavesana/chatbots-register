No, nothing. 
Would you open this suitcase, please? 
Sure. 
Let me take a look at this bag. Can you open it? 
Yup. 
Is this camera a gift for someone? 
No, it's my camera for personal use. 
You have to pay tax for this camera. 
No, please don't. It's is for my personal use.

Almost all are for my friends in the States.
