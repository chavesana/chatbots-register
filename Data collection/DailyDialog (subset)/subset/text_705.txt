[T:] Good afternoon, is there a vacant room here? 
We are practically full up, but I will see. What do you want, a single room or a double one? 
A single room, preferably with a bath. 
How long do you plan to stay? 
For a week or so. 
You can have a room on the second floor. 
I hope it's quiet. I hate noise at night. 
I think you will find it quiet. It faces the courtyard. 
What is the rate, please? 
The current rate is 50 dollars per night. 
What services come with that? 
A radio, a color television, a telephone and a major international newspaper delivered to your room everyday. 
That sounds good. Well, do you give discount for a week or more? 
Yes, we give 5 % discount for one week, 10 % for two weeks and more. 
All right. I will take a room for a week. 
Will you fill out this form, please? The bellboy will show you up to your room. Your luggage will be brought right up. 
Can I get dinner here? 
We do serve dinner. 
I see.
