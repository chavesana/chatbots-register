[T:] Excuse me, sir. May I go with you to claim my luggage? I am a stranger here. 
Sure, I have to go anyway. But the first place you need to go is immigration office. They â€™ ll check your ticket, passport, visa and immunization record book. After that we can go to the baggage claim area. 
Thank you. 
This is my luggage, but it's too heavy. I can't move it. Could you help me get it out of the conveyer belt? 
Certainly, it's a pleasure. 
Where shall we go next? 
Customs. 
Ok. 
Do you have anything to declare? 
No, I don't. 
Would you like to open the suitcase, please? 
Sure. 
What's in the box? 
Chocolates. 
Are they liqueur chocolates? 
No, they are peppermint chocolates. 
How many cigarettes do you have? 
About a 100 and I have had them declared. 
Are you a visitor or a resident? 
A visitor. 
Have a good time!
