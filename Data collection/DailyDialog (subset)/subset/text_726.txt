[T:] Hi. I need more amenities, please. 
Could you be a little more specific, sir? 
Well, to be more specific, the free stuff, like soap, lotion, and shampoo. 
I understand. Now, you're saying that you've already used up all your amenities? 
Oh, no! I've got all I need for my stay here. 
So, what's the problem? 
I need souvenirs! 
You want some souvenirs! 
Yes, yes. Souvenirs. 
But, sir, our souvenir shop carries all those items. 
That's not the same thing. If you buy hotel souvenirs, they have no sentimental value. 
I understand, sir. I'll call housekeeping. You'll have your souvenirs shortly.
