[T:] Hello, I hope to get a room for the night. 
Do you have a reservation? 
Sorry, I don't. 
Let me see if I can fit you in. What kind of room do you want? 
I only need a single room. 
Smoking or non-smoking? 
Smoking if possible. 
You are in luck, we have one free. 
I am very grateful. How much will it be? 
That will be 600 RIB. Could I have your credit card please? 
Oh dear. I don't have it with me. Do you take debit cards or should I pay with cash? 
A debit card will be fine.
