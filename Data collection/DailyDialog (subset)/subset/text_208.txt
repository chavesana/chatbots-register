[G:] Crown Hotel. Reservation Desk. Can I help you? 
Yes, I'd like to book a room at your hotel. 
What kind of room would you like, sir? We have single rooms, double rooms, suites and deluxe suites in our hotel. 
I'd like to book a single room with a bath from the afternoon of October 2nd to the morning of October 6th. 
All right. 
What is the rate, please? 
The current rate is $100 per night. 
What services come with that? 
For $100 you'll have a radio, a color television, a telephone and a major international newspaper delivered to your room every day. 
That sounds not bad at all. I'll take it.
