[G:] Good evening, sir. Are you Mr. Jim Stewart from the States? 
Ah, yes, that's right. 
Glad to meet you. Mr Stewart. I'm the guide from Pacific Tour Agency. My name is Zhang Hua. 
Hello, I was just looking for the guide ã€‚ 
I'm always at your service, sir. By the way, did you have a pleasant trip? 
Not bad. But I've made too many flights these days. I could hardly remember how many take offs and landings I've been through these three days. I think we all feel a bit tired. 
Well, shall we go to the hotel right now? I've already made a reservation for you. 
Wonderful. I'm eager to take a sauna as soon as possible. 
So we must get you to the hotel as soon as possible. I hope to see you refreshed and revitalized tomorrow morning, as we are going to visit the Great Wall. 
I'm sure we will. Actually, we are looking forward to seeing the great wonder.
