[T:] Do you know that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes? 
Just say the word, sir. 
Excellent! Now, as you know, the day has barely begun. 
I agree. The dew is still on the grass. 
I want to hit a few more places in the city, but I need a place to put my luggage. 
We do have a storage space for your bags. There's a small charge, plus a deposit. 
Leave a deposit? Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit? 
Regrettably, no. But simply present your VISA to cover your deposit. 
Hmm. I'll have to think about this for a second. 
Okay, sir, but don't think too long. Your checkout is only 30 minutes away.
