[G:] The May holiday is coming up soon. Are you planning on going on vacation? 
I am. I just went to the travel agent ’ s and picked up these brochures. 
Where are you planning on going? 
I fancy going to Tibet for a few days. Have you ever been there? 
I went a long time ago, before they built the new train that can take you there. 
Would you recommend going there for a few days? 
Personally, I think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time. A few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital. 
You ’ re probably right. What do you think about Yangshao? 
It ’ s a beautiful city, but I think it ’ s become too touristy. How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong? 
I ’ d like to get away from the big city life. 
Maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of Beijing. I heard they are very relaxing. 
I guess if I only have a few days, I should probably think about going somewhere that isn ’ t so far away. 
Since the May holiday is the high season, you should probably call ahead to reserve a room. Here ’ s the phone number. 
Thanks, I ’ ll give them a call later.
