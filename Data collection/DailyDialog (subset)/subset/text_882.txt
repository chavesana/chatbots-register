[T:] Hello, I need a wake-up call tomorrow morning. 
Of course. When would you like the call? 
Actually, I need two calls, one at 7 and the other at 7 fifteen. 
No problem. We'll give you both calls. 
Do you know what, let's change the second call to 7 thirty. 
No problem. Anything else, sir? 
Not at the moment, thank you. 
Let me know if you do need anything.
