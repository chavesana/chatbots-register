[T:] Hello, receptionist? 
[G:] Yes, sir. What's the matter? 
[T:] Could I possibly have a room change? My room is right next to the street, and it's much too noisy. 
[G:] Well, we are rather full, sir. I'm not sure if I'll be able to find a vacant room. 
[T:] Could you please try? 
[G:] OK, sir. I'll do my best.
