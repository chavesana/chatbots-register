[T:] Do you have a swimming pool in this hotel? 
We don't have a swimming pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in the gym. 
I never heard of a swim station. Is that like a train or bus station? 
It's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against. 
Holy cow! I never heard of such a thing. How much do they cost? 
As a guest, sir, you pay nothing. 
This sounds better every second. Now, when can I use the stations? 
If you want to swim, you can visit the gym any day between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. 
Oh, boy! This is going to be great. I'm going to the gym right now! 
I'm sure you'll enjoy your workout, sir. Everyone seems to like the swim stations.
