Sir, you didn't fill out the information on your arrival card of where you will be staying. 
Oh, I'm sorry, but there are a couple of different places I will travel to within the United States, so I wasn't sure what to put. 
You must specify an address of the place where you will spend most of your time.

Yes. I have some travellers cheques and two credit cards. 
Very good. Do you have anything to declare?
