[T:] I've been looking for a swimming pool, but I haven't found one yet. 
We have no pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in our gym. 
Swim stations? Could you be a little more explicit? 
You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere? Well, it's the same thing. 
Gee, that's a great idea. Now, how much do I have to pay? 
The stations are absolutely free to guests, sir. 
Great! Now, when can I go down there and use the stations? 
The swim stations are open daily from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
Boy, oh boy! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks. 
Be warned, sir. At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded.
