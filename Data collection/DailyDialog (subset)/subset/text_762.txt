[G:] May I see your passport please? 
Here is my passport. And this is the declaration form. 
What is the purpose of your visit to the United States? 
Business. I have a trade convention I'm attending in Chicago. 
This visa is good for two weeks. Do you intend to stay longer than that? 
No. I will fly back twelve days from now. 
And you will do some traveling while you are here? 
Yes, I want to spend a couple days in New York. I have friends there I will visit. 
What do you have in the bag, Mr. Lee? 
Just my cameras, my clothes, and some books. 
You're not carrying any food with you today? 
No. 
Okay, Mr. Lee. This is just a routine check. Would you mind opening the bag for me? 
Alright.
