[G:] What's the matter? 
Which subway should I take to get to the East Side? 
Oh, you have to take the shuttle to Grand Central. 
Which train is that? Which platform does it leave from? 
It's not on this platform.These trains are uptown and downtown, not crosstown.You have to go up these stairs over there.
