[T:] Hi! I need to request a wake-up call for tomorrow morning. 
What time do you want the call? 
I need two calls, one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen. 
We can certainly do that. Expect a call from us at 7 o'colock and then again at 7 fifteen. 
Actually, can I change the latter wake-up call to 7 thirty. am? 
I can certainly do that. Is there anything else? 
I can't think of anything. If I do think of something, I'll be sure to call again. 
Okay. Good night, sir.
