[G:] Good morning, Japan Airline domestic reservations. Can I help you? 
Yes. I Would like make a reservation to Huston for tomorrow. 
The flight to Huston takes off daily every two hours from 6:00 to 11:00 pm. So you don't need a reservation. Seats are available on a ' first come, first served ' basis. 
Oh, that's quite convenient. Thank you.
