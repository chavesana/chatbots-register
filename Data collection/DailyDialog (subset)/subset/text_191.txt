[T:] Excuse me, driver, where is the main area for restaurants? 
It's near the Wall Street, a bit far from there. Why not get on the car 
OK. Is there a Chinese restaurant? 
Of course. More than that, you have Italy pizza, English steak, kimchi and local specialties. 
Woo, I can't help being there.
