[T:] Hi, I need broadband for my computer. 
No problem. Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and you're good to go. 
That's a problem. My laptop has no Ethernet port, it's wireless only. 
Hmm. Well, we have some alternatives, if you're interested. 
Go ahead. I'm all ears. 
We have a computer lab on the first floor. 
That's great! How much is it? 
It's absolutely free to guests. Except for printing, of course. 
Okay. What about the other alternatives? 
You could use your wireless right here in our lobby. 
Yes, that's the ticket! And if I need to print something there? 
Well, we don't have a printer in the lobby yet. You'll have to use the lab.
