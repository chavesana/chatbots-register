[T:] Help! Help! 
What's the trouble, ma'am? 
I was taking a walk when a young man came at me from nowhere and snatched the bag off my hands and ran away. 
What did the young man look like? 
Well, he's young, tall and thin. 
To which direction did he run? 
Let me see... my right arm... oh, to the east.
