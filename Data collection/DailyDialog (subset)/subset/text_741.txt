[T:] My amenities bill says that I owe $10 for a movie, but I never ordered one. 
Let's see. It says that you were charged Monday at 9:00 p.m. for the movie ' Titanic. ' 
That's absolutely wrong! I was out exploring the city Monday night. 
Okay, let me see what I can do for you. 
Thank you. I didn't think it would be this simple. 
I can take the $10 off your bill, but I need to charge you $2 for the service. 
Are you serious? I have to pay $2 for a movie I never watched? 
Unfortunately, sir, it's how the computer is programmed. 
This is outrageous! I'm never coming back to this hotel again! 
I'm sorry, sir. Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters.
