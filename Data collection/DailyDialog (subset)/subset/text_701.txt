[G:] Excuse me, have you got any laundry? The laundryman is here to collect it. 
Yes, I have. Here are my blouse, coats and stockings. 
Anything else? 
Oh, yes. My husband also has some laundry. This is his suit and here is his pajamas. 
Are they to be dry-cleaned? 
Oh, no. Only the suit and coat are to be dry-cleaned. I want to have my blouse tomorrow evening. And I'd like the collar and cuffs starched. 
Yes, but not too stiff, right? 
Exactly. Is it possible to have my overcoat dry-cleaned, too? 
There are a few spots on it. I am afraid you will not have it tomorrow. Dry-cleaning usually takes three days. 
Oh, no. I also need this tomorrow evening. 
In that case, I suppose I could ask the dry-cleaner to clean up the spots for the moment, and have it well pressed. You might get it back on time then. 
That's a good idea. 
By the way, a cotton came off your shirt you gave me the day before yesterday. 
Yes, I noticed it yet. 
The laundry has sewed on a new button for you. 
Oh, thanks a lot. 
I am afraid the new one is not exactly the same as the others. 
Never mind, it doesn't matter. 
If you have any more laundry, please just leave it in the laundry bag behind the bathroom door. The laundryman comes to collect it every morning.
