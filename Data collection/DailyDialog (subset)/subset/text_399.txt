[T:] Good afternoon. 
Can I help you? 
Yes, we have a reservation for three nights.Mona White. I called last week. 
One moment please, Ms White. 
Yes, that was for two single rooms, wasn't it? 
I've reserved rooms 402 and 403 for you. 
Are they quiet rooms? 
Well they are facing the street 
but there's a lovely view. 
We'd like quiet rooms thanks. 
Of course
