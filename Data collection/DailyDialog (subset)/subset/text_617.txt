[T:] Have you applied for you visa to go to study in the united states yet? 
Yes, I have. I handed in my application form two weeks ago and I ’ m going for an interview next week. 
Good luck! I ’ Ve heard it ’ s very difficult to get a visa to go to the united states. 
The application form are quite complicated. It took me a few hours to fill it out. The hardest thing was getting all the necessary documents. That took almost two weeks. 
What kind of documents did you need to present? 
I had to show document relating to my financial status and of course my education, because I want a student visa. 
Why do you think so many people have their applications rejected? 
I think that they don ’ t complete the forms correctly or they don ’ t include all the required documents. The embassy is very strict about it. You have to be quite careful. 
Why are they stricter with Chinese people than with other nationalities? 
That ’ s simple. Many people break the rules regarding their visa conditions.
