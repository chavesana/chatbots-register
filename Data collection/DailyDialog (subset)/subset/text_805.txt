[T:] Hello.Hot water overflowed from the bathtub.Will you help me? 
Would you turn off the tap? 
I did it. 
Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door? 
OK. I will. 
I'll have our housekeeper come right away. 
I'm sorry I was too tired to fall asleep. 
When you woke up, the water was coming out of the tub. 
Right.Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance?
