[T:] How can I travel by air? 
[U:] Have you traveled by air before? 
[T:] No, this is the first time. 
[U:] Let me tell you. First you must buy a ticket. 
[T:] Yes, I know. 
[U:] Then you must go to the airport. 
[T:] Is that all? 
[U:] Not Yet. Listen to me. Don't forget to take your ID card with you. 
[T:] What's an ID card? 
[U:] Something like a passport. 
[T:] Can I board the plane now? 
[U:] No, you also need a boarding pass. 
[T:] Thank you. Now I know how to travel by air.
