[G:] Ladies and gentlemen, our flight will be delayed for one hour due to the congestion of the airport. 
Excuse me, Miss.What did the announcement say? 
We'll be delayed for one hour, because the airport is very crowded. 
No kidding! We'll miss the connecting flight. 
Oh, will you? That's too bad.We ' re very sorry to cause you a lot of trouble.
