[T:] This is a very beautiful statue. What's it called? 
[G:] It's called ' Endless Love '. It was a gift from a sister city in Australia for the 100th anniversary of the city. 
[T:] 100th anniversary? When was that? 
[G:] Just two months ago. There were very big celebrations and there was a spectacular fireworks display. I took part in the great parade myself. 
[T:] Sounds real good. It's a pity that I missed that. 
[G:] Yes. We all loved the celebration of our city's birthday. It made the people feel so proud of our city.
