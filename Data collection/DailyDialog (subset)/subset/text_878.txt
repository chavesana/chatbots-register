[T:] I have a reservation for a single with bath. 
We are sorry, but single rooms have been occupied. 
What's the room rate? It is a little expensive for me, do you have any other rooms? 
Then how about this room, with just shower? 
May I see the room? I â€™ ll take this room. Is the rate for the room only? 
No, sir. The tax is included.
