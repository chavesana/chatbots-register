[T:] I think I've looked everywhere, but I haven't seen a swimming pool here. 
This hotel has no full-size pool, but we do have swim stations in our gym. 
Swim stations? Whoever heard of such a thing? 
You swim in a swim station just like you run on a treadmill. 
All that exercise in a little pool! Do I have to pay anything? 
The swim stations are available to all guests for no charge. 
Very good. Now can you tell me the hours of operation? 
They're available anytime between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., seven days a week. 
Wow! I can't wait to change into my trunks! 
The swim stations are very popular, sir. I hope you don't find a line down there.
