One bottle of perfume and a watch. 
Where did you buy it? 
In Boston. 
Do you travel a lot? 
Oh... I go to see my sister twice a year or so. 
Twice a year? How long has your sister lived in Boston? 
Nearly ten years. 
I see, that's a long time.How much was the watch? 
I can't remember, but I've got the receipt somewhere. Would you like to see it? 
Yes, I'd like to see the receipt. Oh! I see you bought the watch last week. 
Yes. Does that mean I'll have to pay duty on it? 
Yes, I'm afraid you will.Altogether on the watch and the perfume you owe me seven pounds. 
Ok. Here you are. Is that all right now? 
Yes, that's fine. I hope you enjoyed your stay in Boston? 
Yes, I did. I had a fine time.
