[T:] Hi, I have a reservation under the name of Sandals. 
Could I see your ID, please, sir? 
Of course! Let me take it out of my wallet. 
Thank you, sir. Now, do you have a credit card, sir? 
Yes, of course. Is American Express okay? 
I'm sorry, sir. Only VISA or MasterCard. 
In that case, here's my VISA. 
Thank you. Your room number is 507, queen bed, nonsmoking. Is that agreeable to you, sir? 
Yes, I'm easy to please. 
Very good. Here is your room key, sir. If you need anything at all, please dial 0.
