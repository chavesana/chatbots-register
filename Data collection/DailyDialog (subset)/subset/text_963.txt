[G:] Hi, are you Catherine? 
[T:] Yes, Jason, right? Nice to meet you. Welcome to Taiwan. 
[G:] Thanks, good to meet you, too. 
[T:] You had a long flight, you must be tired. 
[G:] Yes, and the food was horrible! 
[T:] Oh, sorry to hear that. But, don worry! Taiwan has plenty of great things to eat. First, lets get you to the hotel. 
[G:] Great! How will we be getting there? 
[T:] My car is in the parking lot, lets go this way. Let me help you with your bags.
