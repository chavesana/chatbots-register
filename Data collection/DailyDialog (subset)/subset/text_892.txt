[T:] I hate to do this, but I've got to cancel a reservation I made earlier this week. 
All I need is your name, phone, and reservation date. 
My name is Rudy Randolph. I'm at 818-555-1234. The reservation was for April 9. 
Randolph, Rudy. Let me hit one button, sir, and now your reservation is cancelled. 
Okay, thank you. I'll make another reservation as soon as I can. 
It's been my pleasure to help you.
