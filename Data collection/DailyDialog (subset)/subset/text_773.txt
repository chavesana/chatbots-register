[T:] excuse me? How can I get to the nearest branch of the national bank? 
there ’ s branch on new street. Walk up this street until you get to the first set of traffic lights. Then turn right at the traffic lights. 
how far up the street are the traffic lights? 
not far. About 150 meters perhaps. 
ok. So I turn right at the traffic lights. Then? 
then keep walking until you reach the war memorial. It ’ s a big statue of a soldier. You can ’ t miss it. 
ok. Where do I go then? 
you ’ ll see the national bank near the war memorial. It ’ s a big building and you ’ ll see a big sign on the front of the building. 
got it. Thank you very much.
