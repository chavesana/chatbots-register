[G:] Hello, sir. Have you anything to declare? 
This is my first tourism. I don't know what should be declared. 
OK. Please open your luggage, and I'll tell you what you should declare. 
All right. Here you are. 
You should declare the camera and the film. Do you have alcohol? 
Yes, I have got some special local product, I want to take them for my friends. 
How many bottles have you got with you? 
Four bottles. 
I'm sorry. According to the regulations, a passenger can only take two bottles on to the aircraft. So you cannot take so many. 
What shall I do with my two more bottles? 
You may give them to your friends who come to see you off. This is the Customs Declaration Form. Please fill in it. And then you can go through the other formalities. Be sure to keep the form safe. 
All right, thank you, see you. 
See you. Have a good journey.
