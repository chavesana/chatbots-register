[T:] Excuse me. This chicken doesn't taste right to me. 
[G:] What seems to be the problem? 
[T:] How should I know? It's just kind of cold in the middle. It just doesn't taste right. Do you want to try it? 
[G:] Well, let me get that out of your way. Would you like to order something else from the menu? Or I could bring you another order of chicken if you'd like. 
[T:] Another one? I don't want another one. Give me something simple. You've got steak, right? 
[G:] Yes, we do. How would you like it cooked? 
[T:] Half done.
