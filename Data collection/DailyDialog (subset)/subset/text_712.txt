[T:] I need to know why I'm being charged $10 for a movie that I never ordered. 
Hmm. Your file shows that you watched ' Titanic ' Monday night. 
Monday night? Monday night I was at a great concert. 
Well, as they say, garbage in, garbage out. Let me correct this error, please. 
Thank you. It's very nice when problems can be solved quickly. 
When I deleted the $10, the computer automatically added a $2 service charge. 
Are you crazy? You made the mistake and now you're charging me for your mistake? 
Sir, if it makes you feel any better, the $2 service fee used to be $5. 
Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have? 
Unfortunately, sir, you'll have to pay the $2, whether you like it or not.
