[T:] Excuse me. Can you tell me how to get to City Hall? 
Yes. Go to the next corner and turn left onto Center Street. Walk three blocks to Second Avenue and turn right. Walk two more blocks and you'll see City Hall on the left. 
I'm sorry. I didn't follow you. Could you please repeat that? 
Okay. First, go to the next corner and turn left onto Center Street.
