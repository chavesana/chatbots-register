[G:] Excuse me, sir. Can I help you? 
I'd be glad to have your help. Could you make the air-conditioner cooler? 
I'm sorry. We can not regulate the air-conditioner. As soon as the plane takes off we'll be able to get better ventilation, and the temperature here will drop. Let me get a wet towel for you at the moment. 
Good idea. 
Your wet towel, sir. 
Thank you. Could I have something cold to drink? 
Yes. We have mineral water, orange juice, coke, which do you prefer? 
Orange juice, please. 
Would you like some ice in your drink? 
Yes. 
How much would you like? 
One or two cubes will be OK. 
Here you are, sir. 
I'm awfully sorry to have bothered you. 
It's my pleasure. 
Please accept this tip.
