[G:] Do you have a reservation, sir? 
No, I ’ m afraid we don ’ t. 
I ’ m sorry the restaurant is full now. You have to wait for about half an hour. Would you like to have a drink at the lounge until there ’ s a table available. 
No, thanks, I ’ ll come back later. May I reserve a table for two? 
Yes, of course. May I have your name, sir? 
Bruce By the way, can we have a table by the window? 
we ’ ll try to arrange it, but I can ’ t guarantee sir. 
That ’ s fine. 
your table's ready, sir? Please step this way.
