[G:] Hello, China Travel Agency. Can I help you? 
Yes. I'd like to travel to London. So I want you to make a reservation for me on May 1st. 
Just a moment, please. I'm sorry but the flights are fully booked on that day. The next available flight is on May 2nd. They have two flights, one is at 9:30 a.m. and another at 2:00 p.m. Both flights have seats available. 
That's great! I'd like to take the first available flight. I'll need an economy ticket 
One way trip or round trip? 
One way trip. What's the fare, please? 
Economy fare for one way trip is 2,300 yuan. 
I see. Is my ticket confirmed then? 
Yes, I have confirmed your ticket. 
Here is 2,300 yuan. 
Thank you. Here is the ticket and receipt. Have a good time.
