[T:] But it's the White House. The president and his family live there.They won't let us see most of it. Probably we can only see a couple of rooms. 
No, that's not true.The White House is very big. And there are a lot of historical exhibits there.The tour will take us through many different rooms. I read about it in the guide. 
Hmm. If that's true, then the security there must be very good. Because it's strange to think they will let people walk around in the White House. 
I'm sure the security is very tight. Probably they will make us walk through metal detectors like at the airport. 
So I can't take my gun then. 
Don't always joke like that! You don't have a gun. 
Yes, it's true I don't. 
You shouldn't say things like that. You could get arrested! 
What? Do you think someone will arrest me for making a joke? Someone will arrest me here at the breakfast table? 
No. But if you say something like that in the White House, they may take it seriously. Sometimes I think you joke too much. 
I'll be careful. Don't worry. I don't want to get arrested by the FBI.But how long does the White House tour last? 
I'm not sure. I think it lasts about one hour. 
Alright. We should take a taxi over there right after breakfast. 
First I want to look in the travel guide. Maybe they don't have tours in the morning. 
That's a good idea. Do you want some more coffee? 
No, I'm fine.
