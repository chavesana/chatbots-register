[G:] Good morning, sir! Can I help you? 
Good morning! I'd like to buy twelve tickets to Beijing for October 14th. 
Yes, sir. We have many trains going to Beijing, fast train, through train, express train and tourist train. Which train do you prefer? 
Well, the express one, with air-conditioning. 
Then you'll have two choices. Train No. 14 leaves at 6:00 p. m, and train No. 22 leaves at 8: 00 p.m. 
When do they arrive in Beijing? 
They will arrive the next morning, at 8: 00 a.m. and 10:00 a m. respectively. 
In that case I think Train No. 14 will be better. We can do more sightseeing in Beijing. 
Right. Trains No. 13 and No. 14 are the best trains on the line between Beijing and Shanghai. Which seats do you prefer, cushioned seats, ordinary seats, cushioned berth, or ordinary berth? 
In a cushioned sleeper, please.
