[T:] I am sorry to say this but I seem to have lost the key to the safe. 
Where do you think you lost it? Outside the hotel? 
Yes, I believe so. How should I compensate for this? 
I am afraid, Ma'am, you have to pay 100 US dollars since you lost the key. 
What? 100 US dollars? Is it covered by the insurance? 
I am afraid no. It is not covered by this insurance.
