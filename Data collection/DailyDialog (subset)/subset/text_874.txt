[T:] Hello, this is room 1205. Our message lamp is flashing. 
Hold on a minute, please. 
Thank you. 
I am sorry to have kept you waiting. Mr. Johns needs a telephone call from you. 
Would you bring the message to my room. 
I'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment. 
Then I'll come down and pick up the message immediately. 
OK, we wait for you.
