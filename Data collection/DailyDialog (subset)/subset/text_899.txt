[T:] Hi. My minibar is empty. 
You already finished off everything, sir? 
I finished off everything. 
Would you like anything in particular? 
The Perrier and the Jim Beam. Let me have three more of each. 
Beam and Perrier. Anything else, sir? 
I really loved the apples in my room. Bring me a few more, please. 
Sure thing. Might there by anything else? 
Oh, yes, speaking of fruit, bring me some grape juice, too. 
Perrier, Jim Beam, apples, and grape juice. It will all be there shortly, sir.
