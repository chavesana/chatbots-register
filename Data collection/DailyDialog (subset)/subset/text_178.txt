[T:] Excuse me, Miss. 
What can I do for you? 
I've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed. 
What's your flight number? 
Flight CA216 to Chengdu. 
Yes, it's true. It has been delayed. 
Could you please tell me why? 
Yes, of course. The delay is due to heavy rain. 
How long will the delay be? Do you have any further information about it? 
I am sorry, we don't know the extent of the delay at present. But according to the latest weather forecast, there will be a change in weather soon. 
We have to wait. Well, is it possible for the rain to stop before noon? 
It's hard to say. Weather is so changeable in the summer. Please listen to the latest announcement about your flight. 
Yes, I will. Thanks a lot. Bye! 
Bye
