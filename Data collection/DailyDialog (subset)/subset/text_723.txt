[T:] I'd like to order dinner. 
What would you like? 
I'd like to order a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare. 
I'm sorry. We're currently out of filet mignon. May I suggest the porterhouse instead? 
I'd prefer the filet, but the porterhouse will do. 
And may I suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne? 
Normally, I would take you up on that suggestion, but just the champagne will do for tonight. 
Okay, no strawberries. Room service will be charged to your amenities account. Is that all right? 
That's fine. 
It will be up shortly. Enjoy your food, sir.
