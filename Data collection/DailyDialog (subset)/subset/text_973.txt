[G:] What's the matter? 
[T:] Checking out, please. 
[G:] Can I have your keys, please? Thank you. Here's your statement. 
[T:] Excuse me. What are these charges? 
[G:] Oh, these are the phone charges and these are for something from the bar. 
[T:] Wait a minute. I made a phone call, but I never made a connection. 
[G:] I know, sir. Those aren't telephone company charges. Those are hotel charges. 
[T:] Isn't that a bit excessive? 
[G:] I'm sorry, sir. It's our policy. 
[T:] OK. Here is the money. 
[G:] Thank you. Welcome to our hotel again.
