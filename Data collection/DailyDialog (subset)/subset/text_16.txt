[G:] We are on our way. I think our first stop is Buckingham Palace. 
That's right. I can already see the Palace Garden on the left. 
And here is Buckingham Palace! Look, isn't it beautiful? It is much bigger than I imagined. 
The bus is turning right to Buckingham Gate. And now we are joining Victoria Street. 
Yes we are going towards Westminster Abbey. I can see it now! Look to your right. 
I can see it. The bus is stopping. I think we will be able to go inside. 
This is amazing. I'm glad we decided to take this bus tour. So where next? 
I guess we should see Big Ben soon. 
Yes. It is just round the corner. Oh, can you see the London Eye? Look straight and to your right. 
Look at this bridge. We will soon be crossing the Thames. 
This is Lambeth Bridge. We will then loop back and cross the river again on Westminster Bridge. 
Wonderful.
