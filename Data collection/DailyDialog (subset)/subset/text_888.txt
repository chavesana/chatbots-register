[T:] Hi, I need a hotel room. 
That's no problem at all. May I have your name, please? 
Certainly. My name is John Sandals. 
It's a pleasure, Mr. Sandals. My name is Michelle. What days will you need a room? 
Friday afternoon, April 14 through Monday morning, April 17. 
One minor problem, sir. Our prices are now slightly higher. Is that acceptable, sir? 
Please tell me the price, so I can make a decision. 
It'll be $308 nightly. 
That's a reasonable price. 
Good! Now, sir, do you have a preference for smoking or nonsmoking? 
I quit smoking, so nonsmoking. 
I hear you, sir. Nonsmoking. Now, about the bed, is a queen-size okay? 
A queen sounds great. 
Okay, sir, let me reserve those dates, there. Now, if you'll just tell me your phone number. 
That would be 626-555-1739. 
That's 626-555-1739. Thank you so much for choosing our hotel, sir!
