[T:] I need a taxi. 
We could easily provide you with a private vehicle, if you'd prefer. 
No, the taxi will do. 
Perhaps you'd like to take a beautiful limousine. 
No, thank you. Taxis and I get along just fine. 
No private vehicle, no limo. Got it. Where are you going? 
I'm seeing a show at Rockefeller Center. 
What time should the taxi be here to pick you up? 
I'm ready to go right now. 
I'll have a taxi for you momentarily, sir. 
Great! As soon as I brush my teeth, I'll be downstairs. 
You'll enjoy our new, clean taxis, sir.
