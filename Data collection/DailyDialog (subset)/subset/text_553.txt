[T:] Can you give me more details on what is included in the package? 
[G:] Sure. The coach leaves at 6:30 a.m., in front of our office. The drive takes eight hours, with two stops to see some sights. 
[T:] What about the hotel accommodations? 
[G:] You'll be staying at Holiday Inn. It's a three-star hotel with two restaurants and a swimming pool. 
[T:] Great. What types of things will we do at Lushun Falls? 
[G:] The second day you take a four-hour city tour. In the afternoon you go on the famous boat cruise under the falls.
