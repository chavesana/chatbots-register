[T:] Hmm. You have three cameras. Are you a photographer? 
No, my company makes cameras.Well, I'm also a photographer, but two of these are for our display. 
I see. And what's in this bag? 
Egg tarts. 
I thought you said you didn't have any food with you today. 
I thought you meant vegetables and meat when you asked me. Things like that. I don't have any vegetables. 
I'm sorry, Mr. Lee. Egg tarts are food too. We will have to confiscate these. 
Confiscate? 
Yes, we will have to dispose of them. 
It's too bad. They are very delicious. 
I know. One out of every three travelers from Taiwan seems to be carrying them.They are being smuggled in by the thousands. 
Oh, well. Not by me. 
No, not today at least. Enjoy your visit to the United States, Mr. Lee. 
Thank you.
