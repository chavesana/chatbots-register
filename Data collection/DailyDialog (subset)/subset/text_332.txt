[G:] Royal Hotel, can I help you? 
Yes. I urgently need a room for tomorrow night, and do you have any vacancies? 
Yes, we have. What kind of room would you like? 
I'd like a suite with an ocean view, please. 
No problem, sir. 
What is the price of the suite? 
It is $200 per night. 
It is a little high. I'm told that your hotel is offering discount now. 
Yes, but the offer ended yesterday. I'm sorry. 
Oh, I see. Then do you have anything less expensive? 
No, sir. So far it is the least expensive suite for tomorrow night. 
OK, I will take it. By the way, does the price include breakfast? 
Yes, it does. Now could I have your name, please? 
My name is David White. 
Would you kindly spell it for me? 
That is D-A-V-I-D, W-H-I-T-E. 
Thank you, I got it. And how long do you expect to stay? 
About three days. 
OK. Our check-in time is after 12:00. And see you tomorrow. 
Thank you. See you.
