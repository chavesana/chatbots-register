[T:] Hello. My name is John Sandals, and I've got a reservation. 
May I see some identification, sir, please? 
Sure. Here you are. 
Thank you so much. Have you got a credit card, Mr. Sandals? 
I sure do. How about American Express? 
Unfortunately, at the present time we take only MasterCard or VISA. 
No American Express? Okay, here's my VISA. 
Thank you, sir. You'll be in room 507, nonsmoking, with a queen-size bed. Do you approve, sir? 
Yeah, that'll be fine. 
That's great. This is your key, sir. If you need anything at all, anytime, just dial zero.
