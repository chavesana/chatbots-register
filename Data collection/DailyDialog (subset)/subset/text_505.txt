[G:] Good morning. May I help you? 
I'd like to rent a car, please. 
Okay. Full-size, mid-size or compact, ma'am? 
Full-size, please. What's the rate? 
78 dollars a day with unlimited mileage. 
And I'd like to have insurance just in case. 
Is there an additional driver? 
No. 
If you want full coverage insurance, it will be 8 dollars per day. It includes collision damage waiver and personal accident insurance. 
All right. I'll take it. 
Here is our brochure, ma'am. Err... full-size... OK. Please choose a model in this section. 
How about this one? 
All right. How many days would you like to use it? 
Just one day. 
May I see your driver's license and credit card please? 
Is the international driving licence fine? 
Yes, it is. (... ) Thank you. Please fill in this form. Can you check this box, and put your initials here, and again here.
