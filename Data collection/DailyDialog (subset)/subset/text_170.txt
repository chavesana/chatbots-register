[T:] I'd like to reserve a room. 
Which date would that be? 
For the night of April 18th, for one night. 
I'm afraid our hotel is fully booked on that night. Is it possible for you to change your reservation date? 
No, I'm afraid not. 
We might have cancellations. Could you call us again some other day? 
Sure, but if you do have any cancellations, could you let me know as soon as possible? 
I'm very sorry, sir, but we are unable to do that. We would appreciate it very much if you could call us instead. 
OK, thanks.
