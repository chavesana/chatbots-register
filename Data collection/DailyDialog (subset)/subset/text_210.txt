[G:] Good morning, sir. May I see your passport? 
Yes, of course. Here it is. 
Thank you. Are all these yours? 
No, some of them are my friend's. Do you want her passport, too? 
Yes, please. Do you have any carry-on items? 
Do you want me to put it on the belt, too? 
Yes, please. Would you please open this big suitcase? 
OK. Just a moment. It's just some clothes and toiletries. 
OK. Do you have anything to declare? 
I think there is nothing. 
Any fresh food, live plants, or animals? 
Oh, no. None of that. 
Thank you. You may lock up your suitcase. Here are your passports. 
Thanks a lot.
