[T:] Hi! Does this hotel have an exercise facility? 
But of course! We have a great exercise facility. 
Good. Now exactly where is it? 
It's located right under our lobby. Just take the elevator or the stairs one flight down. 
Is this going to cost me anything? 
No, sir. The gym is absolutely free. However, be sure to take your room key with you. 
When does the gym open and close? 
The hours couldn't be better, 24/7. 
Very good. Now, is there a trainer down there? 
I wish I could tell you yes, but no, there isn't.
