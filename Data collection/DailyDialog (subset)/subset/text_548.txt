[T:] Hi, are you Catherine? 
Yes, Jason, right? Nice to meet you. Welcome to Taiwan. 
Thanks, good to meet you, too. 
You had a long flight, you must be tired. 
Yes, and the food was horrible! 
Oh, sorry to hear that. But, don worry! Taiwan has plenty of great things to eat. First, lets get you to the hotel. 
Great! How will we be getting there? 
My car is in the parking lot, lets go this way. Let me help you with your bags.
