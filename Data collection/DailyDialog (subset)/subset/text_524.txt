[T:] Good morning. I've come here to inquire whether I can get a visa to your country? 
What do you want to go to US for? 
I have been invited to teach Chinese at the University of Hawaii for two years. 
Can I have a look at your letter of acceptance? 
Of course. Here you are. 
That's OK. We'll contact you the moment we hear from home.
