[G:] Good coming. 
Good coming. Are you through with the cleaning? If not, we'll come back a little later. 
Never mind, come right in. I've almost finished.You always keep the room neat and tidy, I must say.It saves me a lot of work, but you should let me do it. 
It doesn't take much time. I'm used to tidying up my room myself. 
It's very considerate of you to do so. Do you have any laundry today? 
I have a suit that needs cleaning. 
Let me have it, please. I'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway.
