[G:] Room service, what can I do for you? 
I have some shirts that need laundering, and I ’ d like my suit pressed. 
There is a laundry form as well as a bag in your room. Pls fill it out and the maid will come pick it up. 
How long will it take to get my clothes back? 
To press the suit only takes 3 hours. The laundry will be returned to you tomorrow around noon time. Is that all right? 
That ’ s all right. Pls send someone to pick it up. 
Right away, sir.
