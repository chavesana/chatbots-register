[T:] Excuse me. Do you speak English? 
Yes, I do. How can I help you? 
Well, I've just arrived in my room, but there are no instructions in English about the facilities available! Could you help me for a moment? 
Of course not. What exactly would you like to know? 
First, what is the number for room service? 
It's 1200. Room service is available 24 hours a day. 
Very good. Now, could you help me to adjust the air conditioning, please? It's too hot in my room. 
Yes, the control unit is on the wall next to the bathroom. Is 24 Â° C all right? 
Yes, that's perfect. Another thing, if need more items for the mini-bar, which Number should I call? 
You should call the Housekeeping Department on 2300. They will replace any stock for you immediately. 
I see. So, is it possible to make international phone calls from my room? 
That's no problem. Just dial 9 to get an outside line, and then dial the number as usual. 
Well, thanks a lot for your help. 
No problem, sir. If there's anything else you need, you can find me at the desk by the elevator, or you can call housekeeping if I'm not there. 
OK, goodbye. 
Goodbye, sir.
