[T:] Could you bring me some food, please? 
Sure. What do you fancy? 
Can I have a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare? 
Sir, the filet mignon was so popular tonight that we ran out. May I suggest the porterhouse? 
Oh, no filet? Okay, porterhouse will be fine then. 
Perhaps you would like chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne? 
Not tonight, but thank you for the suggestion. 
Okay. This will be charged to your amenities account, okay? 
No problem. 
Your food will be brought to you momentarily. I hope you enjoy it.
