[T:] My stay is over. Here's the key to my room. 
Thank you. And here's your receipt, sir. 
Many thanks. 
I hope your stay here was satisfactory, sir. 
This could be a great hotel, once you get rid of the insects. The city itself is great. 
I'm glad that the little problem didn't ruin your visit. Please have a pleasant trip home.
