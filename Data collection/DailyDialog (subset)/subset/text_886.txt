[T:] I need a room for a few days. 
That won't be a problem. Could you please tell me your name? 
John Sandals. That's S A N D A L S. 
Sir, I'm Michelle, and I run the front desk. Please tell me the days you'll be here. 
I'll be there in April Friday through Monday, the 14th through the 17th. 
We recently changed many things here, sir, including our prices. Do you mind, sir? 
Possibly. What's the actual price? 
The price will be $308 a night. 
$308! That's not bad. 
Very good. Now, Mr. Sandals, about the room, smoking or nonsmoking? 
Nonsmoking, definitely! 
Most of our clients prefer nonsmoking. Now, does a queen sound okay? 
Yes, that'll be just fine. 
One more second, sir. Your reservation is now verified, so all I need is your phone number. 
It's 626-555-1739. 
Let me repeat that 626-555-1739. Okay, sir, we look forward to seeing you in April!
