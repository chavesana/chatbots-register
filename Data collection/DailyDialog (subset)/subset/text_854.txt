[T:] Excuse me, can you help me? I would like to change rooms if possible, I couldn ’ t sleep at all last night, because the people in the room next to mine were making a lot of noise, also if at all possible, I ’ d like a room that doesn ’ t overlook the street, between the noisy neighbors and the highway outside, I didn ’ t sleep a wink. 
I am so sorry to hear that sir, let me check and see what is available, what room are you in now? 
I ’ m on the 6th floor, room 698, I ’ v had many problems with that room, just this morning, I called someone up to fix the light fixture in the bathroom, it didn ’ t work, and it still doesn ’ t work. 
Oh, dear, well, it looks like we have a few rooms available, can I put you into a room on the 17th floor? It has a balcony and it doesn ’ t face the highway. 
Ok, that would be very nice! What do I need to do to transfer? 
Let me check you out of your old room, you have to sign here, and acknowledge these changes and also the charges to your previous room. Then I can hook you right up to room 1780. 
Mmm, I don ’ t think the charges are right, can you explain them please?
