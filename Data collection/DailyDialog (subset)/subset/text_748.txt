[T:] Well, I've got a date. Now I need to find a restaurant. Can you help me? 
No problem, of course! How much would you like to spend to impress the lady? 
Nothing but the best for a pretty woman! 
Sir, the restaurant you seek is right here. This hotel has a three-star restaurant. 
Well, I sort of suggested that we would go out on the town. Do you have another suggestion? 
Gramercy Tavern is at least as good as our own hotel restaurant. Plus, they have live jazz. 
Gramercy Tavern, eh? I think I've heard of that before. Call to get us a table, okay? 
Right away, sir. She will be impressed with your local knowledge.
