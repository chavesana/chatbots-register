[G:] Good afternoon. I'll show you to your room. 
[T:] Thank you. 
[G:] Could you tell me which bags are yours? 
[T:] They're over there next to the door. Those three with green tags on them. 
[G:] Could you wait a moment? I have to get a trolley. May I see your room key, please? 
[T:] Sure, here it is. 
[G:] Thank you. Room 402. You're on the 4th floor. This way, please.
