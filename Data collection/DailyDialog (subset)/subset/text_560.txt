[T:] Where do you think we should go on holiday this summer? 
We, I ’ d like to go to Australia. I know it ’ s far to go, but I think it would be something different and special. 
I ’ d really like to go to the Caribbean. We can relax on the beached and enjoy the sunshine. 
There are beaches in Australia too, but I would prefer a more active holiday this year. We could visit Ayers rock and the great barrier reef. It would be so exciting. 
But would it be relaxing? By summer. I ’ ll be quite tired from doing so much work. The last thing I need is to use more energy racing around Australia. I ’ d need another holiday to recover from the holiday! 
Oh, come on! A tour of Australia would be relaxing because you ’ d be doing something different and not working. 
Do you think so? I ’ m not so sure. Anyway, tell me your plans for an Australian holiday. How long do you think we should spend there? 
I think we should go for two weeks. We could spend a week in the bush and a week at the great barrier reef-including a few day on the beach for tired office workers! 
That doesn ’ t sound too bad. I ’ d certainly like to go diving. That ’ s one reason I wanted to go to the Caribbean. 
We could hire a car and travel around the interior of Australia for several days. If we hire a car, we can go where we like. 
We ’ d have to plan our drive before we leave. Let ’ s get a good guidebook from the bookstore when we go shopping in town tomorrow. 
It looks like I might have convinced you to go to Australia!
