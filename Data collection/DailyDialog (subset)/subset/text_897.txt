[T:] Hello, I've got to get up early tomorrow, so please give me a wake-up call. 
Of course. We can give you a call anytime you like. 
Actually, I need two calls, one at 7 and the other at 7 fifteen. 
Your wish is our command. Expect a call at 7, and another one at 7 fifteen. 
Wait a minute! I don't like 7 fifteen, now that I think about it. Change it to 7 thirty. 
The second call is now changed to 7 thirty. Is there anything else we can help you with? 
Nothing that I can think of right now. If something comes up, though, I'll call you. 
We're here all night long if you need anything.
