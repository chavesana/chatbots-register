[T:] I'm going to New York for the first time, but I don't have a tour guide. Can you give me any suggestions? 
There's a service called ' A friend in New York '. It's a personal tour guide service. 
That's interesting. What does it do? 
You give them your information by answering a questionnaire and they will create a perfect trip for you according to your budget. 
Good. Where can I get the questionnaire? 
You can easily download it from their website.
