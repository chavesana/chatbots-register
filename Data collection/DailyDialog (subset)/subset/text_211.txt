[T:] Good evening! This is Mr. Smith in room 609. 
Good evening, Mr. Smith, What can I do for you? 
I'm going to Shanghai early tomorrow morning. So I would like to request an early morning call. 
Yes, Mr. Smith, when would you like us to call you tomorrow morning? 
I have to be at the conference room of the Garden Hotel in Shanghai by 10 o'clock. I think it will take me three hours to get there. It means that I'll have to be on the road before 7 o'clock at the latest. 
That's right. 
Well, in that case, I would like you to wake me up at 5:45. 
OK. Good night, Mr. Smith, Have a good sleep. 
Good night.
