[G:] Good morning. Your ticket and passport, please? 
Here you are. 
Do you have any baggage to check in? 
Yes, one box. 
Would you please put it on the scale? 
OK. By the way, can you tell me how many kilos of free baggage each passenger is allowed? 
The baggage allowance is different according to the class of your ticket. What class are you travelling? 
First-class. 
For a first-class passenger, the free baggage allowance is forty kilos. 
How many pieces of baggage can I carry on to the plane? 
Passengers holding first class tickets may carry 2 pieces within the total weight of 5 kg onto the plane. 
If my baggage exceeds the allowance, what should I do? 
If the checked baggage is over the allowance, we will charge you for the overweight. 
I see. Thank you very much for your information. 
You're welcome. Your boarding pass and baggage check, please. 
Goodbye!
