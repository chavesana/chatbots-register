[T:] Is everything alright? 
Yes, everything is fine. 
What took so long? I thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago! 
Didn't they announce that our flight was delayed? 
I didn't hear anything about a delay. I thought everything was running on time. What happened? 
We boarded the plane on time, but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem. 
Then what? Your plane was three hours late! 
We finally took off, but about 30 minutes later, the captain came on to the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight. 
Turbulence is pretty normal, isn't it? 
Yes, but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life! Everyone started getting sick. The flight attendants had to stay in their seats. The captain decided to land early. 
So where did you land? 
We landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again. 
That sounds like a nightmare! 
It wasn't too bad. At lease I'm alive. 
Have you had anything to eat? 
I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant. How about you? 
I had a few coffees while I was waiting. Let's get out of here!
