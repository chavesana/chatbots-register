[T:] In case you didn't know, I'm checking out in half an hour. 
That won't be a problem, sir. 
That's good to hear. Now there's still a whole New York day ahead of me. 
You're right, sir. Your whole day is still ahead of you. 
I still have time to explore more of New York, but I need a place to secure my baggage. 
We have a storage place here, but you have to leave a deposit. 
A deposit, huh? I would think my baggage would be enough of a deposit. 
Just present your VISA card, and there won't be any problems. 
That deposit bothers me. Give me a minute. 
Okay, sir, but remember how close it is to your checkout time.
