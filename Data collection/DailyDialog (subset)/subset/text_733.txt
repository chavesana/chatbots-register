[T:] Hi, can you tell me where I could make a copy of a document right now? 
Sir, you can come downstairs right now to the computer lab. 
That's great. I don't suppose the copy machine is free for guests? 
Sir, each copy is ten cents or one dime, whichever you prefer. 
In the good old days, it was only five cents a copy. I'll be right down. 
Those were the good old days, sir, indeed.
