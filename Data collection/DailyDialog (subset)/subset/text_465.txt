[G:] How was your self-help trip? 
Excellent. As soon as we landed, we boarded a bus to Disneyland. I love Mickey Mouse. Janet and I spent the entire first day going on all of the rides. 
Didn't you feel any jet lag from the change in time zones? 
I felt fine. I must have been too excited to notice. 
I've never been to Disneyland. I went to Universal Studios when I was fifteen. My parents took my brother Franco and I to Los Angeles and San Francisco.Wish you and Janet love each other more.
