[G:] Good afternoon, ma'am. May I help you? 
[T:] Yes. Can I deposit valuables here? 
[G:] Of course, you can. Please put your articles in this bag and seal it. 
[T:] OK. 
[G:] Thank you. Here is your tag. 
[T:] Would you tell me the rate per day for depositing my bag? 
[G:] Sure, madam. Only one dollar. 
[T:] When does the cloakroom close? 
[G:] This cloakroom is open until 10 p.m. 
[T:] Oh, dear! I won't be back until about 11:30 tonight. Where can I pick up my bag? 
[G:] We will transfer your bag to the Lobby Floor Cloakroom. You may collect it there, madam. 
[T:] I see. Thanks a lot. 
[G:] You're welcome.
