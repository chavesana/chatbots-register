[T:] Could I order dinner? 
Of course. What would you like? 
I want a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare. 
I'm so sorry. We ran out of filet mignon. May I suggest the porterhouse instead? 
That's too bad, but the porterhouse will be okay. 
May I be so bold as to suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne? 
Not tonight, thank you. 
No strawberries. We'll charge your amenities account, if that's okay. 
Charge it to whatever account you like. 
Your meal will be delivered as soon as it's all ready. Enjoy!
