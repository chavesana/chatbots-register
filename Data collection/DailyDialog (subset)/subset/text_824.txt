Of course. Reservations aren't necessary, but we recommend them as our restaurant can get quite busy. 
I need a table for two for tonight. 
What time? 
We'd like to be seated at 8p m. 
Smoking or non? 
Non-smoking. 
What name is the reservation under? 
My name is Paul. 
Ok. Please arrive at seven forty-five. We can only hold the table until 8,15.
