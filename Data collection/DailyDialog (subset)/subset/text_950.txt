[T:] It's very kind of you to show me around. 
[G:] Not at all. What would you like to see first? 
[T:] I really don't know. 
[G:] Let's walk around the lake first, shall we? 
[T:] Yes, that would be lovely. 
[G:] Have you been here before? 
[T:] No, it's the first time I've been here. 
[G:] I will take you to Li River after walking around here. 
[T:] That's wonderful! I have heard the scene of Li River is beautiful! 
[G:] Yes, you'll be in a different world there.
