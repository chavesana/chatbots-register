[G:] Yes, sir.May I help you? 
Please I'd like a ticket to New York. 
For today? 
No, early saturday morning. 
We have a flight that we'll put you there at ten AM.Is that ok? 
Nothing earlier? I prefer flight at nine thirty. 
I'm afraid not, unless you want a night flight. 
No, exactly not 
How about afternoon? 
Sounds not good. I won't take it.
