[T:] I'm taking my date to a restaurant. Could you tell me about one or two good ones? 
My pleasure! How much would you like to spend on your date? 
She will want an excellent restaurant, of course. 
You should know that our hotel chef was trained in Paris. The service and food are world-class. 
I wanted to go out somewhere, not stay here. Do you know of another good restaurant? 
You can't go wrong with Gramercy Tavern. It's famous for its food, service, and live jazz. 
I like that! Could you please call them to see if we can get in tonight? 
At once, sir. You'll love this place, I assure you.
