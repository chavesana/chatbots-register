[G:] Good afternoon. Can I help you? 
Yes, I would like to check in. 
Do you have a reservation? 
Yes, my name is Steven Smith. I have a reservation from October 2nd to October 6th. I called last week. 
Wait a moment, please. Oh, yes, Steven Smith. It's for a single room with a bath. Is that right? 
Yes, that's right. 
Now, Mr. Smith, could you fill out this registration form, please? 
OK. By the way, where is the restaurant? 
The restaurant is on the second floor. Here is the key to your room. It's on the 6th floor, room 609. The elevator is over there. And we also have a cafeteria on the top floor, if you would like something to drink, you can also call room service. 
Thank you.
