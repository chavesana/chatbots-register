[T:] Hi, I want to check out. Here is my room key. 
One second, sir, while I print out your receipt. Here you are. 
Thanks. 
May I ask, sir, if you enjoyed your stay? 
Well, except for one night, I enjoyed the hotel. And I loved New York, of course. 
Thank you for your honesty. I assure you there will be no cockroaches next time.
