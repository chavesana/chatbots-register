[T:] I'm afraid I have lost my air ticket while I was shopping. 
I'm sorry to hear that.Did you check your shoulder bag carefully? 
Yes, I checked again and again, but I can't find it. By the day after tomorrow, can I have the ticket reissued? 
I'm afraid you can't. 
I talked with the manager over the phone and he told me I can have it reissued because I have a copy of my lost ticket. 
Oh, I see. I'll call the manager, then.
