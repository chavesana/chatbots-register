[T:] Does this hotel have a pool? 
I'm sorry, sir, we don't have one. However, in our gym, we do have swim stations. 
I'm not sure I understand. 
Think of a deep bathtub that you can swim in, but against a current. 
Cool. What will they think of next? How much are they? 
Sir, guests pay nothing to use the stations. 
Excellent! Now what are the hours? 
The gym is open 24/7, but the stations are open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. only. 
I'm going to change into my trunks right now! 
I think you'll like the experience, sir. It's a great workout.
