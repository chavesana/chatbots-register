[T:] I'd like to order room service to room 202, please, 
How can I help you? 
I'd like two sandwiches and one green fruit salad, please. 
Will that be all, sir? 
No. Could you also get some extra towels and soup too? We went to the pool today and used up our two clean towels. 
I will have someone bring that up right away. How would like to pay for the dinner? 
Just put in on with the rest of my hotel bill. 
All right, sir. You would receive dinner in about 15 minutes.
