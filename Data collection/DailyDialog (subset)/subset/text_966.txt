[G:] Is there anything I can do for you, Mr. King? 
[T:] I'm leaving for Shanghai tomorrow morning. When do I have to settle my bill? 
[G:] Is it all right for you to pay the bill this evening? 
[T:] That will do. Where shall I go to pay the money? 
[G:] At the Cashier's Counter of our hotel, right in the lobby downstairs. 
[T:] Would you please get the bill ready before supper? 
[G:] All right. Is your companion leaving for Shanghai with you? 
[T:] No, he will stay here for two more days. Please keep the room for him. 
[G:] Shall I make out a single bill or two separate bills? 
[T:] Two separate bills, please. 
[G:] OK. I'll surely have the bill ready for this evening. 
[T:] Will you give the bill to me at around six o'clock? 
[G:] No problem. By the way, do you have any comment to make on our hotel? 
[T:] I have had a good stay here. Your service is wonderful. I'm very satisfied with it. 
[G:] Thank you for your compliments. You're welcome to our hotel again. 
[T:] OK, I will.
