[T:] Hi, I'm Benjamin. Nice to meet you here. You look great. 
[G:] Thank you. Nice to meet you too. I'm John. Is this your first time to take a long-distance trip on plane? 
[T:] No, this is the second time. But I also feel bad because of the lower pressure and the jet lag. 
[G:] Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Take it easy. It will be OK soon. You see, I take this long-hour plane frequently, but the jet lag still makes me uneasy. 
[T:] Oh, that's too bad. Do you get a good knowledge of China? 
[G:] Yes, whenever I think about China, I'd see the Tian'an Men Square. China is a very beautiful country. And I've seen many landmarks in China but I like the Great Wall most. 
[G:] All of the Chinese are proud of the Great Wall. And it was built before the In dynasty near Shan Haiguan-the First Pass in the World. 
[T:] Was it built before the In dynasty? I thought it was in the Ming dynasty. 
[G:] No, before the In dynasty. 
[T:] Oh, yeah. Thought I am an American, I know quite a lot about China and I like Chinese tea very well. 
[G:] Both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health. And I usually refresh myself with a cup of tea. 
[T:] Yeah, many of my friends like Chinese tea and whenever I go back to China, I'll take some Dragon-well green tea for them. 
[G:] Do you like the Chinese traditional silk? 
[T:] I heard about it, but I don't have any clothes made from silk. 
[G:] Go and pick some stuff up. The price can always surprise foreign friends. 
[T:] Oh, I'm eager to have a try.
