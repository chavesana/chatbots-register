[T:] Hello! Tomorrow I'm going to need a wake-up call. 
Not a problem. What time shall we call you? 
I always hit the snooze button, so give me two calls, one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen. 
It'll be our pleasure. We'll call you at 7 and then at 7 fifteen. 
Oops, cancel that. Change the second call to 7 thirty will you, please? 
No sooner said than done. Can I help you with anything else? 
No, that's about it for now. Thanks. 
Okay, sir. Have a pleasant evening.
