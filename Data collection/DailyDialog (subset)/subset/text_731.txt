[T:] I'd like to request some more amenities. 
Amenities? What do you mean by amenities, sir? 
Well, the free stuff! You know the soap, lotion, shampoo, etc. 
I see. Sir, if I may ask. Have you used up all the amenities in your room? 
Not at all. I still have enough for the next few days. 
Then what is the problem, sir? 
I need some to keep as souvenirs! 
Souvenirs? 
Yes, souvenirs. Trinkets to remember my trip by! 
We do have a souvenir shop on the first floor, sir. 
Oh, that's not the same. I never pay for hotel souvenirs! 
I'll call housekeeping. Someone will be up with more amenities shortly.
