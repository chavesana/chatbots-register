[T:] Hello.Is this room service? 
Yes.May I help you? 
This is room 1425.We asked for the room service an hour ago. 
We're very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience. 
What's the matter? 
We're rather busy right now.It will take another 15 minutes. 
Is it really going to take that long? Will you rush the order? 
I'm afraid it would take 15 minutes at most. 
Ah, well, we have no choice.
