[T:] I'm calling to cancel a reservation I made earlier in the week. 
To cancel your reservation, I need your name, phone number, and date of trip, please. 
Rudy Randolph, 818-555-1234. My reservation begins on the second Monday of April. 
I see your reservation on my computer. Let me just cancel it, and you'll be all set! 
Thanks. I'll call again when things get better at home. 
You're welcome.
