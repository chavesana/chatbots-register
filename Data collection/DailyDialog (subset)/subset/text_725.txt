[T:] Can I order something from the kitchen? 
Just tell me what you'd like, please. 
A bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare would hit the spot. 
I hate to tell you this, but we have no more filet mignon. May I suggest the porterhouse instead? 
Sure! Right now, I would even eat hamburger! 
Have you ever tried chocolate-covered strawberries with champagne? 
Thank you, but I just finished eating some chocolate-covered cherries. 
That'll be a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and porterhouse, all charged to your amenities account. 
Not a problem. 
Please call if you have any other requests. Your food will be delivered promptly.
