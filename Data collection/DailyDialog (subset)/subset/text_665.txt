[T:] I'd like to make a reservation to Rome. 
When are you planning to go? 
I'm supposed to be in Rome on the morning of the fourteenth, but I'd rather get there on the evening of the thirteenth. 
What time would you like to leave? 
Late in the afternoon, after work. 
We have a flight at four thirty. 
That's too early. I don't get out of work until five. Do you have a later flight? 
The next flight is at five fifteen and there's another at six thirty. 
I'd better take the six thirty. It takes quite a while to get to the airport. 
Yes, we have a seat available on that flight on the thirteenth. 
Oh, good. What time does the flight get to Rome? 
The flight only takes an hour and a half. It arrives at eight o'clock.
