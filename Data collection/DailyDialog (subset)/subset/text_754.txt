[T:] I need to get a taxi. 
We have a variety of transportation services. Would you prefer a private vehicle to a taxi? 
No, that won't be necessary. I just need a taxi. 
Perhaps you'd prefer a limousine. That's such a stylish way to travel. 
Just a taxi, please. 
And what is your destination? 
I'm going to Rockefeller Center. 
I see. What time do you want to depart from the hotel? 
I want to leave as soon as possible. 
Okay, a taxi will arrive in seconds, sir. 
Thank you, I'm coming down now. 
It won't be but a few seconds, sir.
