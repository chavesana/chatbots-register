[T:] Yes, please.[T:] Yes. This is room 207. There isn't any hot water in my bath room. Can you send somebody here, and do something about it? 
[T:] I am glad you are here! See if you can find the problem. 
[T:] Thank you for repairing it. 
[T:] Yes, I'm missing a sweater. I sent it in the laundry yesterday, but my laundry was returned without it. 
[T:] 505. 
[T:] That's all right[T:] Yeah, the people in the next room are a little loud. Could you do something about it? 
[T:] I'm in Room 215. 
[T:] I don't know the number, but it's definitely the room that's next to the stairs. 
[T:] OK, thanks. I really appreciate it.[T:] I'd like to make a reservation to Los Angels for next Monday. 
[T:] I'll need an economy ticket with an open return. 
[T:] I guess that's OK. What time should I check in?
