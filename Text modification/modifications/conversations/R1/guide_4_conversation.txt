Hello there! My name is <Tour Guide A>. What can I help you with today?
What kind of accommodation are you looking for?
Okay, we definitely have some options that would fit that. If you're comfortable with a hostel, we have the Motel du Beau and the Grand Canyon International Hostel in downtown Flagstaff, or if you're looking more for a traditional hotel you can stay at hotels like the Super 8, Days Inn, Knights Inn, etc. Prices for all Flagstaff hotels change pretty much daily, but you can easily search online for prices if any of those interest you.
What kind of food do you like?
We have most cuisines in downtown Flagstaff.
 There are quite a few local breweries in the downtown district, like Mother Road and the Lumberyard, that also serve food. We have great BBQ and southwestern style restaurants as well!
Ok that's fine!
There are some very good options that aren't spicy. We have Mix on the Square, which is a soup and sandwich kind of restaurant, and Beaver Street Brewery is an American-Italian restaurant as well as being one of our local breweries.
Their address is 120 N Leroux, and they're right in the center of downtown Flagstaff in the Old Town Shops.
For that, I would definitely recommend staying at one of the hostels in downtown Flagstaff. There are always international and younger travellers looking for groups to go places with, and it's a great way to connect with other people.
Yes, the two that are downtown are the Motel du Beau and the Grand Canyon International Hostel.
Okay perfect, I'm happy to help!
