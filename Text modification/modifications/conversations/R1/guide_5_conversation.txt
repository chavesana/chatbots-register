Hello there! My name is <Tour Guide A>. What can I help you with today?
Oh no, that's fine. Flagstaff actually isn't too hot in the summer! We're at 7000 feet, so our summers are usually around 85 degrees F at the hottest.
A lot of visitors will either rent a car and travel to Flagstaff or fly in to Phoenix and rent a car there. Phoenix is only a 2.5 hour drive south of Flagstaff, and the drive is easy.
You can also take the Arizona Shuttle from the Phoenix airport if you don't want to rent a car.
If you don't want to rent a car, there is a public bus system that you can take most places in Flagstaff. A day pass for the bus is only $2.50, and most of the bus schedules are very convenient. As for leaving Flagstaff, that gets a little trickier.
You can take the Arizona Shuttle to Grand Canyon, but for Sedona and Antelope Canyon you would need to take a tour. Grand Canyon Adventures is a tour company that operates out of Flagstaff and can take you most places, but I know that for their Sedona trip they require a minimum of 4 guests.
 There's also the option of a private tour guide - Johnny Anaya is a local historian, and he will do private tours anywhere you want to go in Northern Arizona. He's taken visitors to Sedona, Grand Canyon, and all the way up to Monument Valley.
For seeing the big highlights in town, you can definitely do that in three days. I'd recommend starting small and staying close to town to see the attractions in the area, and then you can spread out to Sedona and the attractions that are farther out.
Absolutely! What kind of hiking do you like to do? (Level of difficulty, length, etc)
Okay, for a moderate hike I would recommend either the Oldham trails or the Elden Lookout trail. Both of the trails are out-and-back, meaning that you just need to turn around and go back down the trail when you want to head back. They both go along Mount Elden.
Oldham starts at Buffalo Park and is an easy to moderate hike. You'll be in the forests for most of the time, but with some scenic viewpoints at places. Elden Lookout is the one with a beautiful scenic view; you can look out at the volcano fields to the east of town from the top.
You can check out the USDA website for more detailed information on the hikes in the Flagstaff area, and they also provide trail maps on the website as well. <link>
Is there anything else I can help you with today?
