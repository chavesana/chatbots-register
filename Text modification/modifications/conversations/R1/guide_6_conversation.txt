Hello there! My name is <Tour Guide A>, how can I help you?
Absolutely! What kinds of things do they like to do, and what is the age range of the group?
Okay, so a pretty wide range. Do you think they would be interested in museums, outdoors, local attractions, etc?
Would they be interested in a scenic drive? The loop road up at Sunset Crater and Wupatki national monuments would be a perfect place to visit to still take in the sights but without any hiking.
Absolutely. That loop road would be perfect for them, and depending on when they visit you could also take them up to the Arizona Snowbowl for the scenic chairlift ride. It brings you up to about 11,500ft and you can see the Grand Canyon in the distance from the top. If they'd like a short walk around downtown, there is a historic walking tour brochure at the Flagstaff Visitor Center and it's an easy walk where you can also learn the history of the town and check out the local shops and galleries.
At the Flagstaff Visitor Center, we have a guide called Explore Flagstaff that gives a 5-day itinerary that you can easily expand into 10 days.
It is sectioned off into different areas, such as day trips, grand canyon, historic, and so on.
Sure! If you want a full day, I would say you can visit Walnut Canyon national monument - just 15 minutes east of town on I-40 - and go out to the Meteor Crater, then loop back to town for lunch and head up to the Sunset Crater and Wupatki ruins.
You can find information on all of the attractions I've listed at our website, www.flagstaffarizona.org, and then for any of the national monuments they also have their own websites. For the national parks, if you have a national parks pass it is free for everyone in the vehicle, otherwise it's $20/car at Sunset and Wupatki and $8/person at Walnut Canyon.
Not to worry, I understood! I'm looking at Flagstaff365.com, and I see that there are quite a few concert series going on in August.

Here is the link to my August search.
Flagstaff 365 is the events website for Flagstaff, and they update nearly every day with more events and activites
So even if there isn't something listed right now that would interest you or your family, there may be other events posted in a month or two for that timeframe.
You can also go to www.flaglive.com for more music-focused events.
Flag Live does list events in Verde Valley, but otherwise these websites are Flagstaff-focused.
 We don't have as much information for the Phoenix area, unfortunately. I do know that they have a downtown First Friday event, like we do here in Flagstaff, but also keep in mind that in August, Phoenix will be significantly hotter than here in Flagstaff. Where we'll be in the 80s, they can be in the 110-120 range.
Absolutely! For the music, your best bet is to look at the Flag Live website. It will have the most up-to-date information available, and you can also look at the Oprheum's schedule at <link> to see if they have any rock bands coming in.
For the highlights of Flagstaff, you can look at <link>
We don't really have any night clubs. The closest I can think of is Collins Irish Pub.
The Museum Club has line dancing, but that's completely different from a night club.
The Orpheum is a concert venue, but it also has a bar in it that is only open during performances.
Not a problem, thank you for letting me know! The Museum Club isn't an actual museum - it's a country music venue and is original to Route 66. You can see their schedule on their website at <link>
They teach you how to dance, so even if you don't know how to line dance it's very easy to pick up!
Is there anything else I can help you with? If you're in town, you can also come by the Flagstaff Visitor Center to pick up maps and brochures about what we've discussed. We're in the train station in the Downtown area.
I'm glad to help!
