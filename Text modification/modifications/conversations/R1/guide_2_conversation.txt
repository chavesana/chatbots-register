Hello there! My name is <Tour Guide A>. What can I help you with today?
What kinds of things do they like to do? Buffalo Park is always a great option for smaller excursions, and the trails are easy for little ones.
There's also the scenic chairlift at the Arizona Snowbowl that all ages can enjoy.
One moment, let me read through the rest.
Ok, so for August there is a chance of monsoons but otherwise it is always lovely to go outdoors and hike and mountain bike.
Grand Canyon is open year-round, except for government shut downs, which we've had issues with in the past. The most they do is close the road to the desert view watchtower for wintery road conditions.
Winter is actually a great time of year to go to the Canyon, because it's the off-season and there will be a lot less travellers there during that time.
That really depends on the weather. It's unpredictable here, as we saw this past winter where we barely had any snow, and so we never know what the weather is going to do. The best thing to do is check with the staff at the Grand Canyon visitor center, or give them a call in the weeks leading up to the trip to see what the trail conditions are like. With little ones, if you're concerned about the rim, I would stay close to the main village area and Mather Point, which are both much more secure.
For the cultural events, the Museum of Northern Arizona hosts several festivals throughout the year. If you go to their website, www.musnaz.org, and click on "Programs & Events," you'll be able to see the full list of festivals. Beyond that, we do have some national monuments close to Flagstaff that are ruins - Wupatki are pueblo ruins 45 minutes north of town, and Walnut Canyon is only 15 minutes east on 40, and those are cliff ruins.
Okay perfect. I'm glad I could help!
