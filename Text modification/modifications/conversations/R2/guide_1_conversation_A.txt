My name is <Tour Guide A>. To answer your question what kind of food are you looking for?
We have 85 locally-owned and operated restaurants in the downtown area. Is this for breakfast or lunch? To give you an idea, we have diners, southwest, Mexican, Italian, pizza, cafes, vegetarian, and so on.
We have some really great Thai restaurants downtown. If you're looking for very traditional Thai with fish sauce, Swaddee is on Aspen Ave, and then Pato Thai is right up San Francisco St, about a half block up from the Hotel Monte Vista.
Not a problem! Is there anything else that I can help you with today?
Okay! Thank you!
