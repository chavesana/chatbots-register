If you only have one hour in Flagstaff, I would explore the historic downtown area. there are many shops, local restaurants and art galleries in the area and this will give you a good feel for the community.
A couple highlights are the historic two spot train, the Hotel Monte Vista, The Weatherford Hotel and the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church.
you are welcome
