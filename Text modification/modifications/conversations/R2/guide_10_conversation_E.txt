Hello. If you want a Southwest-style breakfast (on the spicy side) go to Martanne's (112 Historic Rte 66). For frou-frou breakfast with lots of options, Toasted Owl is good (12 S Mikes Pike St). And tradition breakfast with big portions, go to Mike & Ronda's The Place (21 S. Milton).
I would say the Grand Canyon, it's iconic and on many "bucket lists". Sedona is closer however (30 minutes vs. 1.5 hours), so if you are pressed for time, I would say that the red rocks of Sedona are definitely worth seeing.
