Hello. How can I help you?
There is two hour free parking on Rte 66, on the side streets east of San Francisco on the Southside, and there is free parking in the neighborhoods west of City Hall. Paid parking downtown is $1 per hour, pay with a credit card at the kiosks located throughout downtown by entering your license plate #. The parking system tracks your license plate and knows that you paid (no receipt given).
I do not have that information specifically, but hopefully the attached link will help. <link>
The Starlight bookstore on Leroux sells used books,15 N Leroux St, Flagstaff, AZ 86001. It is across the street from the visitor's center to the north. You can get a map of Flagstaff at the visitor's center to further help navigate.
