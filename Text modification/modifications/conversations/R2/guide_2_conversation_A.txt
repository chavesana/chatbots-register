Hello there!
There are a couple of sports bars and restaurants downtown. I'd recommend trying Majerle's on Route 66/San Francisco first, and then Charly's Pub & Grill, Collins Irish Pub, or The Market would also likely have the match on.(England scored already in the first 5 minutes!)
It'll definitely be an interesting game! Did you have any other questions?
Yes, there's The Garden Thrift just south of the tracks on Beaver Street/Phoenix Ave.
There are other thrift stores in driving distance as well.
