There is a self-guided Rte 66 tour that starts in the Historic Train Center on 1 E. Rte. 66. In the visitor's center, there is a self-guided map that shows the original alignment through the redeveloped Southside Historic District and passes by classic drive-in motels and Flagstaff landmarks of old. Let me know if you have further questions.
There are not any areas that are open to the general public, but the Pioneer Museum has a map of the tunnels. You could ask individual business owners if you could see them.
