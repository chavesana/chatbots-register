The Grand Canyon is what brings most of the visitors to Flagstaff.
Brix restaurant is on North San Francisco Street, about three blocks north of downtown.
Yeah this would be a nice trip. you would leave Flagstaff at 8:57 and it would be an over night train to Los Angles where you would transfer trains and head to Santa Barbra.
