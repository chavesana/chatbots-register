Flagstaff was formed in 1882 as a railroad town.
It was named Flagstaff because when the explorers were surveying the area they reached this area on the centennial of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and stripped a pine tree of its branches to raise up their American Flag. it was known from then on as Flagstaff.
