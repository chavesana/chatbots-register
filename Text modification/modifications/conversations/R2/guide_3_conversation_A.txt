What can I help you with today?
Typically there is only free food during various festivals and events downtown, like the monthly Art Walk. If you're in need, there is the Food Bank located at 3805 E Huntington Drive on the east side of town.
There are a number of inexpensive food options downtown, though. I know that Fratelli's has slices of pizza that are usually around $3, and the pastries at Macy's Cafe and Mozelle's are reasonably priced, too.
Did you have any other questions?
