How can I help you?
The Museum of Northern Arizona is 3 miles north of downtown it is definitely worth it. they have great exhibits on the native cultures of our region as well as the geology and paleontology of our region.
Yes it is interesting and fun to work in this part of the city.
Sedona is also worth a visit. the red rocks in there are beautiful, and the new age arts culture of Sedona is very unique.
You can leave your car parked on the east side of the Visitor Center for $1 per hour. the west lot is only 15 minutes.
No the museum is on Highway 180, from the Visitor Center you will take a left on Route 66, a right on Humphreys street and when Humphreys ends at highway 180 make another left then watch for the signs.
The admission to the museum is $12 of adults, $10 for seniors or military, and $8 for Children.
you are welcome
