Flagstaff was established in 1882, so it is 137 years old.
What type of things do you like to do?
The Flagstaff urban trail system would be good Buffalo park or the Sinclair wash trail are two easy ones I recommend. Also the area National Monuments Sunset Crater, Wupatki and Walnut Canyon would be  great options.
