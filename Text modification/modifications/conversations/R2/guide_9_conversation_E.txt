Hello. How can I help?
Red Curry Kitchen is a good vegan restaurant, 10 N San Francisco St, as well as Whyld Ass Restaurant 121 E. Birch Ave (just east of San Francisco). A lot of restaurants offer vegetarian options, including the locally-made Tepa vegetarian burgers.
Thorpe Park is your closest option with playground equipment. Santa Fe Ave. & Thorpe Park Rd. going towards Lowell Observatory.
