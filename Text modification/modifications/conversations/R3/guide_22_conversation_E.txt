Hello.
For food or tourist-type attractions?
Most close at 5pm, but Lowell Observatory is open until 10 pm. Sunset Crater and Wupatki can also be driven through after 5 pm, although their visitor centers are closed.
I think it will be. It might clear up by evening and you can go back for the same price.
