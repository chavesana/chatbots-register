Hello. Flagstaff was officially founded in 1881.
Hmm I don't have an exact number for you, but the Flagstaff Visitor Center gets about 91k visitors every year, and the number has been rising.
Flagstaff is a central hub for Northern Arizona, and many of our visitors stay here and do day trips outside of the Flagstaff area. For the city itself, there is the Route 66 history, Lowell Observatory (where they discovered Pluto), the museums and national monuments, as well as our year-round festivals.
you're very welcome
