Hello. Flagstaff is a university town, so we have what I would describe as a semi-active nightlife scene. There aren't any dancing clubs, but there are a number of breweries and local bars with music, trivia nights, and so on.
What kind of music do you like?
The Hotel Monte Vista is good for alternative/rock music, and the Museum Club is better for country and two stepping.
country, folk, pop rock, indie
Hops on Birch will book singer/songwriters to perform, and has a great selection of beers.
Oh, another good option to look at would be the Green Room.
Let me check for you.
They're all open on weekdays, it just depends if they have anything booked.
You can check flagstaff365.com and Flag Live's "Pulse" section, which is more centered around music events.
You're welcome!
