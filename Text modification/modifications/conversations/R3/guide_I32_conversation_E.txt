Hello.
I would suggest walking around the historic downtown. there are self-guided walking tours inside the visitor's center that will give you a sense of the history of Flagstaff that are about an hour long.
yes - but you will need to park on the other side of the building if you are in 15 minute parking. It's $1 an hour, pay at the kiosk by the green dumpster.
Walk up San Francisco St to Aspen Ave. It's been in many films.
