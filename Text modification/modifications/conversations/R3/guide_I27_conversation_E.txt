Hello.
There are private rafting guides that go through the Grand Canyon, but those are often booked out years in advance. You wouldn't be able to bring a personal kayak down to the river.
Flagstaff Extreme at the Ft. Tuthill Park has a good adventure course. You could do a half day river trip from Page, AZ relatively easily.
It's about $100 <<link>> The Flagstaff Extreme is $52. A pamphlet is inside the visitor's center.
