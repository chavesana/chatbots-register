Hello.
How can I help?
Tell me a little about your interests. Do you like hiking & outdoor activities?
There are 50 miles of trails within Flagstaff - get a Flagstaff Urban Trails Map within the visitor's center. There are also good mountain biking trails near Ft. Tuthill County Park and on some of the Forest Service trails.
I'd also check out our 3 area national monuments - Sunset Crater, Wupatki, and Walnut Canyon. Most of their hikes are shorter, but nice scenery and Native American artifacts.
Humphreys will be the most challenging with a rewarding view, followed by Mt. Elden. Specific elevation gain, mileage, etc. is within the visitor's center. Make sure to check weather prior as we frequently have thunderstorms and lightening this time of year.
To do both, I would recommend Historic Brewing on San Francisco or Dark Sky Brewing on Beaver St. For a large menu selection with beer, Lumberyard is another good choice. Check out the Ale Trail map in the visitor's center.
