Hello. How can I help you?
There is limited parking, but they do have a parking lot that can accommodate RVs.
This time of year, you shouldn't have any trouble finding RV parking. Parking is free, but it is a national monument so they have a park entrance fee. Do you have a national parks pass?
Perfect! That will cover everyone in the vehicle, so you don't have to pay the entrance fee.
You're welcome
