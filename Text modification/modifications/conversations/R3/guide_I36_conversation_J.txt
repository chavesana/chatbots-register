The first day i would visit The historic downtown to get a feel for the town. Then we have some great monuments, Walnut Canyon, Sunset Crater, and Wuptkai. Great hiking trails from Arizona Snowbowl and near Mount Elden. I would do these outdoor activities in the mornings then in the afternoon when it's raining you can visit Museum of Northern Arizona, Riordan Mansion, and Pioneer Museum.
i would give a couple hours to each
you are welcome
