Hello. What kind of tours are you interested in doing?
There are a couple of options. Johnny Anaya is a local historian who does specialized tours for visitors.
You can also look at a couple of the tour companies in the area. Let me pull up their names.
Okay, All Star Grand Canyon Tours and Grand Canyon Adventures are both tour companies that do tours of northern Arizona attractions.
They both have small vans, around 10 passengers maximum I believe.
You're very welcome.
