Hello.
They are not allowed on the trails. Most of the trails are short (0.25 miles or so) to the Native American dwellings. If there are two people, you could take turns.
The Anasazi are reported to have lived there in the 1100 time period. They are not a tribe still in existence.
There are a few Coconino National Forest campgrounds close in the area between Sunset Crater and Wupatki. Bonito Campground is one option, Daisy Springs another. They are more on the primitive side.
