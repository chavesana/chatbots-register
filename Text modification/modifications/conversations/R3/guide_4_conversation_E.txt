Hello.
There is not a AAA office in Flagstaff (the closest is Prescott). There are a lot of maps and information within the visitor's center that would be able to help with trip planning.
If you want to purchase a cabin, the closest realtor is da Vinci at 111 E Aspen Ave #3
Yes, maps are inside at the visitor's center. Ask for both a Discovery Map and a Destination Map (which includes every street in Flagstaff)
