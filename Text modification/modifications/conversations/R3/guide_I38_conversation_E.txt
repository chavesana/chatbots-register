Hello.
How can I help?
You must be accompanied by a guide. You can drive up and get on a tour at Lower Antelope Canyon. It's about $50. The Upper Antelope tours usually drive people to the location on Jeeps.
You could, but it's not entirely necessary. Lower Canyon is $10 cheaper, but there are more stairs involved, which might be tough for the 4 year old. The back of the jeep tour to upper antelope might be fun for both of them.
