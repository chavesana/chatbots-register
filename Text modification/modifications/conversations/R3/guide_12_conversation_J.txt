Flagstaff Extreme Adventure Course would be a good option or there are some rock climbing area such as the Pit and Priest Draw or many mountain biking trail such as Shultz creek or the upper and lower Oldham trails.
Yeah there is a kids course for smaller kids or they must be able to reach the middle of their palms to a height of 5’11″ (180 cm) while keeping their feet flat on the ground to do the adult course.
you are welcome
