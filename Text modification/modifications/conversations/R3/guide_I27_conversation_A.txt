Hello.
The majority of downtown is $1/hour to park, excluding the American Valet-run parking lots, which are more expensive. You can park at the Visitor Center for 30 minutes for free 8-5pm, and outside of those hours it is free to park. You can also park a few blocks north or west of downtown on neighborhood streets for free.
