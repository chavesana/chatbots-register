Hello.
How can I help?
Lowell Observatory is very popular, as are the three national monuments in the area (Walnut Canyon, Sunset Crater, and Wupatki).
The Museum of Northern Arizona is well known for its Native American cultural artifacts.
Walnut Canyon is the next exit outside of town on 40 East. Maybe 15 minutes. Sunset Crater is 19 miles outside of town on 89 N.
There are a few rim trails around the monument. I would ask for the Area Monuments newspaper behind the desk at the Visitor's Center for more specifics.
I cannot confirm that information on their website, but typically most Monuments have a few RV parking spaces.
