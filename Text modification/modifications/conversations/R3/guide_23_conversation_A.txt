Hello. I would recommend going in to talk to the bakers at Macy's European Coffee Shop downtown. They make delicious custom cakes.
They need a couple of days' lead time to be able to put custom orders on the schedule.
If that doesn't work, there are of course the bakeries in Fry's, Safeway, and so on, but I find local bakeries to be a bit better.
I can't remember offhand how much I paid for a half sheet cake last time I ordered. You can give them a call. Their number is (928) 774-2243
You're very welcome!
