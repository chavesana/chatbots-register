Hello..
There are shuttles between the locations. Arizona Shuttle goes to Grand Canyon and Sedona, and there is a shuttle called National Park Express that goes to Page where you can get a tour of Antelope Canyon or there are guided tours from Flagstaff by Grand Canyon Adventures. Also For Sedona there is Inspire Shuttle
Arizona Shuttle is $32 each way plus park entry for Grand Canyon and $45 each way for Sedona. Sedona Inspire is $60 each way. Not sure what the pricing is for National Park Express
you are welcome.
