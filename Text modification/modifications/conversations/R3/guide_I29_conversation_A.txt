Hello.
There are a few options to choose from. Are you looking for more local restaurants, chains, fast food, etc?
Okay. For local restaurants, a couple of good options would be Beaver Street Brewery, Charly's Pub and Grill, and Big Foot BBQ.
Yes, all of those options are downtown. I can give you other options outside of downtown if you want?
Okay perfect. Is there anything else I can help you with?
