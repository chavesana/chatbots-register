Hello. what can I help you with?
It really depends on what you're interested in because they are very different locations. Did you want to hike, whichever one you go to?
or more sightsee?
Okay. Do you have a National Parks pass? (This will help with my recommendation)
Okay perfect! In that case, I would definitely recommend going to the Grand Canyon. It is included in your national park pass, and you can easily spend a full day there. Once you park, you can take the free shuttle buses around the canyon and are able to access most of the park that way.
The only exception is the Desert View Watchtower, which I highly recommend.
You're welcome!
