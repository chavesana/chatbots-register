Hello. What style of food do you like?
There are a number of great Mexican restaurants in Flagstaff, but you'll have to drive. I would recommend Agave, Salsa Brava, and La Fonda's are all good options.
You can also get some Mexican food at Charly's Pub and Grill in the Weatherford Hotel.
Charly's is located downtown, yes.
Most of the area attractions close at 5pm, but Lowell Observatory is open until 10pm on weekdays and is great for stargazing.
You're welcome!
