Hello. what can I help you with?
The best place to visit for volcanoes would be Sunset Crater Volcano, 30 minutes north of town on 89.
You can't walk on Sunset Crater, but Lenox Crater is accessible and they have a trail to the top of that one, and you can look out at Sunset Crater from it.
The Lenox Crater trail is about 1.5-2 hours round trip.
you're welcome
