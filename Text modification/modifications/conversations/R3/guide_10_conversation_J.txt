Hello..
What are your interests? Are there any items that you know you want to see?
One day could be hiking the San Francisco peaks. Humphreys is the highest point in Arizona and you can hike to the top or for a more mellow trail. The Sunset Trail is nice too. Another day could be seeing our monuments, Sunset Crater and Wuptaki are really neat to see.
