Hello. It depends on what you're interested in: history, museums, outdoors, shopping, local, monuments?
Okay.
How long a hike would you be interested in?
Okay! I would recommend the Fatman's Loop/Elden Lookout trails in that case. Beautiful views and easy to moderate.
This time of year, you can do these hikes in the middle of the day and it's still lovely. It can get pretty cold in the mornings, but that can be nice for a good midday view of the surrounding area.
you're welcome!
