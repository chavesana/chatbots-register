Hello..
 Yeah You can spend one day in Sedona and two days in Flagstaff and get a good Overview if you are planning to visit Grand Canyon I Would add one more day to your itinerary if possible.
What Are your interests?
There are some great hikes up on the San Francisco Peaks such as The Aspen Nature Loop, and The Kachina Trail.
For Parks we have three National Monuments that are great places to visit Sunset Crater, Walnut Canyon and Wupataki.
Kachina Trail is 5 miles each way and the Aspen Nature Loop is 2.5 miles so it would depend on how long you want to hike both have great views and nice Aspen stands to walk through.
