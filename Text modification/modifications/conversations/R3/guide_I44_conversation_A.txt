Hello. The train to the Grand Canyon leaves from Williams, 30 minutes west of Flagstaff on I-40. The train here in Flagstaff goes east-west along Route 66 and goes Chicago to Los Angeles.
You would need to drive or take a taxi to Williams, or you can take the Arizona Shuttle there.
Yes, it costs around $35 each way on the shuttle. You might get a better price with a taxi.
You're welcome.
