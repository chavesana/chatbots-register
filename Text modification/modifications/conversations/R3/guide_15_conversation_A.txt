Hello. So to answer to your question, basically it's because of mineral deposits in the rocks. Here is some information from the Sedona website: 
"The red rocks of Sedona are formed by a unique layer of rock known as the Schnebly Hill Formation. The Schnebly Hill Formation is a thick layer of red to orange-colored sandstone found only in the Sedona vicinity."
Red rocks are pretty common in Northern Arizona, and even up into Utah.
There are a number of jeep tour companies in Sedona. Pink Jeep Tours is the oldest tour company down there, and their offices are in Uptown Sedona across from their Chamber of Commerce
