Hello. What can I help you with?
What kind of restaurant are you looking for? (Italian, Indian, diner, BBQ etc) We have a wide variety of local restaurants to choose from.
Okay! Some really good sandwich places I've been to are Aspen Deli and Proper Meats and Provisions downtown, and there's also Crystal Creek Sandwich Company on Milton Rd.
Well all of them are locally owned, and Proper Meats sources their products from the region. They cost a little bit more ($12 for a sandwich vs. 6 or 7) but are well worth it.
Aspen Deli is a family-run business and their sandwiches are delicious.
You're very welcome!
