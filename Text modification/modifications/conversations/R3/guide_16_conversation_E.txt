Hello.
The train leaves from Williams, AZ, about half an hour from Flagstaff. The train leaves in the morning, has live music and play-acting robbery on the way. It drops you off at the train depot at the Grand Canyon Village, just a few short walking minutes from the Rim of the Grand Canyon. It leaves the canyon around 3:45pm
More legroom and more privacy with the pricier seats.
