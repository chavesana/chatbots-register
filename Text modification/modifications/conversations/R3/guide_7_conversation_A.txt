Hello. The Hotel Monte Vista is where they shot part of Casablanca, but unfortunately renovations over the years have altered the interior from what it looked like in the movie.
The hotel is one block north on San Francisco St from the visitor center and you are allowed inside. They have a cafe and bar in the hotel.
You're welcome
