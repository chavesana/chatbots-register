Hello. What kind of restaurants are you both interested in?
Ok. Do you want something a little more middle/high-end? One really nice traditional Italian pizzaria in the downtown area is called Pizzicletta. They do personal-sized pizzas and open at 3pm.
That one is in the mid-price point, not expensive.
There is also Criollo Latin Kitchen, which has a great twist but isn't exactly Mexican food, so it would be different.
You're welcome!
