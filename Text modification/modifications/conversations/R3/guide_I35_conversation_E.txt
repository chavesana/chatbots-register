Hello.
I went with a relative who is very afraid of heights (won't fly), and he did okay. There are some sections where the Canyon juts out further that might not be for you, but there are many viewing points with good railing (like Mather Point) that would make it well your while and you will feel safe enough.
At many of them, they do. Some that also come to mind are Hopi Point and around the east side of Yavapai Geology Museum (you should go inside for an amazing window view too.)
You should do okay and it's quite an experience.
