Hello. What can I help you with?
Parking downtown is $1/hour for any city-run parking. There is also a company called American Valet that runs a number of the parking lots downtown, but they charge $2-3/hour. The Flagstaff Visitor Center has free 30 minute parking available 8-5pm, and it is free to park in that lot after hours.
definitely. The Visitor Center is in the center of downtown, and most everything downtown is locally owned and operated. Downtown has managed to keep much of its historic buildings intact.
You're welcome.
