How can I help you?
The only tent only campgrounds in Northern Arizona is Manzinita Campground in Oak Creek Canyon between here and Sedona, but there are some great National Forest campgrounds up here as well that would allow RVs just no hookups
Bonito Campground near Sunset Crater is nice and so is Canyon Vista Campground on lake Mary Rd.
you are welcome
