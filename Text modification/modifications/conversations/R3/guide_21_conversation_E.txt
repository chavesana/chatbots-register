Hello.
How can I help?
Good to know. I would suggest Diablo Burger for fancy burgers. I also think Lumberyard, Historic, or Dark Sky Brewing have good food and craft beer as well. Don't go to Criollo or Martanne's.
I would choose one of the hotels near Lucky Lane. They are not near downtown or the train if rest is what you need the most. Grab the visitor's guide inside the visitor's center, it will have all the phone numbers to make reservations.
