Hello. what can I help you with today?
We don't have any zoos in northern Arizona. The closest you'll find is Bearizona in Williams, 30 minutes west of Flagstaff, which is a drive through wildlife park.
Yes it is, but if you are concerned about the car they do have a Wild Ride Bus Tour option scheduled a couple times a day. What's really nice about the bus tour is that they will talk to you about the animals that you see in the park.
Not a problem!
