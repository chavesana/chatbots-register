Hello. There are two museums in the area: The Pioneer Museum is about the founding of Flagstaff, and the Museum of Northern Arizona focuses on Native American and geologic history.
Pioneer Museum has a couple of different exhibits. Upstairs, there is a "Flagstaff through the decades" exhibit, and outside on the ground they have an exhibit of pioneer equipment from the ranchers, loggers, and so on.
They also have a main exhibit titled "Todos Unidos" which is an exhibit about the hispanic population and how they affected how Flagstaff was shaped and founded.
you're welcome
