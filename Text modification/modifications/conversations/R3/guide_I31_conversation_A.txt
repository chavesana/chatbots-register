Hello. What can I help you with today?
What are you interested in? History, museums, outdoors, shopping, monuments, etc?
There are two museums north on 180 from downtown, the Pioneer Museum, which is about the founding of Flagstaff, and the Museum of Northern Arizona, which focuses on native american and geologic history.
We also have three national monuments in the area. Walnut Canyon is 15 minutes east on 40, Sunset Crater volcano is 30 minutes north on 89, and the Wupatki pueblo ruins are just another 15-20 minutes after the volcano.
Yes, they did! There are a few ruins there, and the largest one had about 100 rooms.
Researchers think that it was used as a major trading hub, because there are artifacts that were found there from peoples far south of us in Mexico.
The main ruin does require a bit of walking, but if walking is an issue there are also lookout points where you can sit on a bench and see the ruins. The trail makes a loop around the main ruin, and it is paved and an easy grade.
