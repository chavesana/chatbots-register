Hello.
Sunset Crater has a number of shorter relatively easy hikes that go through lava fields. I would grab the Area Monuments guide newspaper inside the visitor's center behind the desk.
They do not have that since the cinders around it are incredibly loose. I would recommend Meteor Crater if you want to look into the inside of a large impact (although that was a huge meteor and not a volcano)
