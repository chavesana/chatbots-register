Hello. I believe doing all three of those in one day could be doable. Dinosaur Tracks is in Tuba City, so I would recommend starting there and making your way back down to Flagstaff as you visit each location.
I recommend planning at least 1-2 hours at each location.
Okay in total, you're looking at about 3 hours of driving
Sunset and Wupatki are along the same loop road
you're welcome!
