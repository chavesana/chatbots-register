Hello. what can I help you with today?
Historically, Flagstaff is known for Route 66 and its location close to the Grand Canyon. Lowell Observatory is also located here, which is where Pluto was discovered.
The observatory is well worth a visit. They are open from 10am-10pm Monday-Saturday, 10am-5pm Sunday. There are solar viewings and tours during the day, and once the sun sets they begin nighttime observations.
I would recommend wearing warm clothing, because you will be outside for the nighttime viewing.
Of course! Do you have any other questions?
