Grand Canyon Adventures has one. <<link>>
1.5 hour tour of Antelope Canyon, lunch at Lake Powell, going to Horseshoe Bend and Transportation from your hotel and back.
Not too much. Horseshoe Bend is 1.5 miles roundtrip. Antelope Canyon isn't alot of walking, since they want to give plenty of time for photographs.
