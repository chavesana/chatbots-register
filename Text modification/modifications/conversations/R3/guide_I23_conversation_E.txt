How can I help?
Tell me a little more about your interests. Do  you enjoy craft beer?
I would recommend getting the Ale Trail sheet from the Visitor's Center. It shows the 9 craft breweries, most in walking distance of downtown. If you get stamps from all (no purchase necessary) you get a free souvenir glass.
Also there is a musical performance starting at 6 pm at the Museum of Northern Arizona this evening.
I am not sure - it is a male and female performer, probably singer-songwriter combo. The downtown area is safe to walk around. Most breweries close on the earlier side anyway (before midnight)
It is about 2 miles from the Visitor's Center on Ft. Valley Rd. At Humphreys St., you will see signs to for the Museum of Northern Arizona
