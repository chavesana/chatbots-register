Hello.
Does your family enjoy outdoor activities, such as hiking?
The Lowell Observatory has good exhibits for all ages. You can go to exhibits during the day and come back at night for the same price. On weekends, they also have music, family movies,  and children activities at Heritage Square starting at 4:30
When the sun goes down, they have astronomers manning the telescopes. They close at 10 pm.
The tours are usually an hour and they have several throughout the day and evening.
There is a brochure in the Visitor Center that gives a small sample of the daytime exhibits.
