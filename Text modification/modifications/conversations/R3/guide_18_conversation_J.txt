Yeah  but still well worth the trip if you go to the east rim or walk along the rim trails you can always find uncrowded places.
no it is about the same as here unless you hike into the Canyon
Yeah you can. there are some suggested day hikes that you can do on either the Bright Angel Trail or the Hermit trail that are shown on the Hiking map that can be picked up at the Visitor Center.
you are welcome
