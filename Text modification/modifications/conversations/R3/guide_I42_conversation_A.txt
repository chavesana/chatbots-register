Hello. what can I help you with?
Would you prefer paved or unpaved trails?
Ok then I would recommend the trails at Buffalo Park. It's at the base of the mountains and has a beautiful view the entire time.
We have a massive urban trail system with hundreds of miles of trails, and if you are interested you can pick up a map in the Visitor Center.
You're welcome
