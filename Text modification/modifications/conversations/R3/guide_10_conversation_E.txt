Hello.
Upper Antelope Canyon tours do not have steps. They do take you to the location on a Jeep Tour, but once you are there you can walk through with the guide without stairs. Lower Antelope does have stairs.
They are typically about $60 for Upper Antelope. Inside the Visitor's Center they have a full listing of the Antelope Canyon tours behind the desk.
