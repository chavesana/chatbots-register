Hello. Yes, the Flagstaff Visitor Center has two city maps. There is the Discovery Map, which is more geared toward visitors and highlights the important attractions, and there is also a map produced by the Chamber of Commerce that has all the streets on it that is more for relocation.
There are definitely some good ones! Downtown has managed to preserve more of the original route 66 buildings than further out in town. If you stop by the Visitor Center, there is a Route 66 walking tour brochure that you can pick up to see and read about them.
Outside of downtown, definitely stop by the Museum Club in East Flagstaff. It opened around the same time as Route 66 was founded, and they still play country music there today.
The tunnels still exist, but unfortunately they aren't accessible to the public any more. I know that our local historian, Johnny Anaya, tried to organize a tour of them a few years ago, but they have been blocked off and walled up in many places.
I've been down to the basement of Blendz, a wine bar on Aspen Ave, which still has access to its part of the tunnel, but it isn't open to the general public.
It may be worth stopping in to ask, though!
Of course.
Did you have any other questions?
ok, have a good day!
