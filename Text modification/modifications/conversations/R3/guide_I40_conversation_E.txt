Hello.
How can I help?
There are some very pretty red rocks there and has different scenery than Flagstaff. If you like hiking there are some good ones there, but also just nice to go to some viewpoints. The shopping area can be a bit too much in my opinion.
If you head down 179 to the Red Rock Scenic Highway there are several viewpoints. Also Schnebly Hill has some good viewpoints and the Airport Rd. overlook
Lots of iron in them.
