Hello..
there are shuttles between the locations. arizona shuttle goes to GrandC and sedona, and there's a shuttle, national park express, that goes to page where you can get a tour of antcanyon or a guided tour from flagstaff by GrandC adventures. also for sedona there's inspire shuttle
arizona shuttle is $32 each way plus park entry for GrandC and $45 each way for sedona. sedona inspire is $60 each way, but i'm not sure what the pricing is for national park express
i'm here to help you.
