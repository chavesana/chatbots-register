Hello.
upper antcanyon tours do not have steps. you will be taken to go to the location on a jeep tour, but once you are there you will walk through with the guide without stairs. LowerAnt will have stairs.
 $60 for UpperAnt. inside the visitor's center there is a full listing of the antcanyon tours behind the desk.
