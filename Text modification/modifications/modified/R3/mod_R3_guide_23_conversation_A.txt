hello. my recommendation is going in to talk to the bakers at macy's european coffee shop downtown. the bakery makes delicious custom cakes.
bakers need a couple of days' lead time to put custom orders on the schedule.
alternatively, there are the bakeries in fry's, safeway, etc,, still i like local bakeries a bit better.
i cannot remember offhand how much i paid for a half sheet cake last time for my order. you can call. the number is (928) 774-2243
i'm here to help you!
