Hello.
at the visitor center we have 30 minute free parking on the west lot, and it will be monitored. you can park on the east side of the building for $1/hour, and there will be a kiosk to pay for your parking on the sidewalk close to the building and lot.
the OldTown shops is a small shopping mall indoors two blocks away from the visitor center and there are good public restrooms.
it will be located on heritage square.
i'm here to help you!
