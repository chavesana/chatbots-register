Hello.
i went with a relative who is afraid of heights (will not fly), and he did okay. there are some sections where the canyon juts out further that might not be for you, but there are many viewing points with railing (like mather point) that would make it well your while and you'll feel safe enough.
at many of the places, they do. some that also come to mind are hopi point and around the east of yavapai geology museum (you should go inside for a window view.)
you should do okay and it is quite an experience.
