hello. there are two museums in the area: the pioneer museum is about theing of flagstaff, and the museum of NorthernAZ focuses on native american history in addition to geologic history.
pioneer museum has a couple of different exhibits. upstairs, there is a "flagstaff through the decades" exhibit, and outside on the ground there is an exhibit of pioneer equipment from the ranchers, loggers, etc,.
there is even a exhibit titled "todos unidos" , an exhibit about the hispanic population and how that affected how flagstaff developed.
