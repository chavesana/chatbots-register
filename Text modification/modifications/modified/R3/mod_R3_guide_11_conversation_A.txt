hello. what is there for me to help you with?
it depends on what you are interested in as those aredifferent locations. will you want to hike, whichever one you go to?
or more sightsee?
Okay. Do you have a National Parks pass? (This will help with my recommendation)
okay perfect! in that case, i would go to the GrandC. your national park pass includes it, you can spend a day there. once you park, you take the free shuttle buses around the canyon to access a majority of the park that way.
the exception is the DesertV watchtower, i highly recommend.
i'm here to help you!
