Hello.
A big U shaped turn?
This?
<<picture>>
that is horseshoe bend in page, az. it is 2 hours from flagstaff on 89 n.
it is free with a national parks pass. there are signs from the road and it is a 0.75 mile distance to hike.
no. there will be a $30 pass there at the parking lot. we have other parks to consider, i would pay to get the america the beautiful pass for $80 at any national park or monument.
you could even go to SunsetC national monument (19 miles outside of flagstaff on 89, on the way) to obtain one at their visitor's center.
You would leave the Parks pass on your dashboard, so not to get a ticket at Horseshoe Bend.
