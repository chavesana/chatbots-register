what i think is flagstaff extreme adventure course would be a good option or there are some climbing area such as the pit and priest draw or many mountain biking trail such as shultz creek or the upper/lower oldham trails.
yeah there's a kids course for smaller kids or your child must reach the middle of their palms to a height of 5’11″ (180 cm) while keeping their feet flat on the ground to do the adult course.
