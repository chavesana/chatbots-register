hello. what is there for me to help you with?
parking downtown is $1/hour for any city-run parking. there is also a company, american valet that runs a number of the parking lots downtown, but the fee is $2-3/hour, and the flagstaff visitor center has free 30 minute parking available 8-5pm, and there is no charge to park in that lot after hours.
definitely. the visitor center is in the center of downtown, plus most everything downtown is local. downtown has managed to keep much of its historic buildings intact.
i'm here to help you.
