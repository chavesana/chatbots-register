the SweetShp on aspen ave. in walking distance is good.
you cannot leave it in 15 minute parking for an extended period of time. on the amtrak side of the building, there is a payable parking lot. $1 per hour, the kiosk is by the green dumpster. pay by credit card and enter your license plate #
right, so you pay by cash at the park flag office on beaver street. (above aspen). you would probably be fine to walk to that while in 15 minute parking. it closes soon.
