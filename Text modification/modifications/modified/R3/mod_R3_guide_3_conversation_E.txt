hello. do you have 3 full days in flagstaff, or will that also involve side trips to perhaps sedona, GrandC, etc.
museum of NorthernAZ, lowellobs, and the 3 area national monuments are good to do around flagstaff. we also have 50 miles of trails.
i would go to the GrandC and make a trip to sedona while you are around.
i would give yourself at least 2 hours at the museum, go to lowell for two hours and then come back in the evening for stargazing, and 3 hours at wupatki/SunsetC and 2 hours at walnutc.
hiking is an option you might try going to, i would give yourself a day at GrandC and at sedona. otherwise, half a day for each.
That is a quicker pace suggestion; some people like to take more time.
