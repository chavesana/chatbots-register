Hello.
there are private rafting guides that go through the GrandC, but people often book those out years in advance to get a spot. you wouldn't be able to bring a personal kayak down to the river.
flagstaff extreme at the ft. tuthill park has a good course. you could do a half day river trip from page, az relatively easily.
it is $100 <<link>> the flagstaff extreme is $52. a pamphlet is inside the visitor's center to look at.
