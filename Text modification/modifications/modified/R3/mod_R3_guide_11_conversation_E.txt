Hello.
the park does not allow dogs to walk on the trails. many of the trails are short (0.25 miles or so) to the native american dwellings. with two people, you could take turns.
historians report that the anasazi have lived there in the 1100 time period. the tribe is not still in existence.
there are a few coconino national forest campgrounds close between SunsetC and wupatki. bonito campground is one option, daisy springs another. that one is more on the primitive side.
