Hello.
how shall i help?
you are basically in the middle of it. on whichever side of the tracks is the downtown historic district and southside historic district.
The neighborhoods of Townsite and La Plaza Vieja are the original neighborhoods to the slight west.
yes. there are self-guided walking tours inside the visitor's center that gives history of buildings and a public map .
