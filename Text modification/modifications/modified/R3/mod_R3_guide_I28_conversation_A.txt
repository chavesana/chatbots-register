hello. what shall i help you with today?
historically, what people know flagstaff for is route 66 and its location close to the grandc. LowellObs is also here, where the discovery of pluto was.
the observatory is worth a visit. the place opens from 10am-10pm monday-saturday, 10am-5pm sunday. there are solar viewings and tours during the day, once the sun sets nighttime observations begin.
my recommendation would be wearing warm clothing, you will be outside for the nighttime viewing.
do you have any other questions?
