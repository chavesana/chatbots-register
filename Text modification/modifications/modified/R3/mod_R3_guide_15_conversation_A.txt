hello. so to answer to your question, basically it is due to mineral deposits in the rocks. here is some information from the sedona website: 
"the red rocks of sedona are formed by a unique layer of rock known as the SchneblyH formation. the SchneblyH formation is a thick layer of red to orange-colored sandstone in the sedona vicinity."
red rocks are found throughout NorthernAZ, even up into utah.
there are a number of jeep tour companies in sedona. PinkJeep tours is the oldest tour company down there, and the offices are in uptown sedona across from the chamber of commerce
