Hello.
how shall i help?
well you must be accompanied by a guide. you drive up and get on a tour at lower antcanyon. it is $50 for one. the UpperAnt tours drive people to the location on jeeps.
you could, but it is not entirely necessary. lower canyon is $10 cheaper, but there are more stairs involved, which might be tough for the 4 year old. the jeep tour to UpperAnt might be fun for both.
