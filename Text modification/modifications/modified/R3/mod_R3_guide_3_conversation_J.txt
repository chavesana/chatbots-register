Hello..
 yeah you can spend one day in sedona and two days in flagstaff to get a good overview depending on whether you're planning to visit GrandC i'd try to add one more day to your itinerary.
What Are your interests?
there are some hikes up on the san francisco peaks such as the aspen nature loop, and the kachina trail.
for parks we have three national monuments that are great places to visit SunsetC, walnutc and wupataki.
kachina trail is 5 miles each way and in addition the aspen nature loop is 2.5 miles so it would depend on how long you will have wanted to hike. both have great views and nice aspen stands to walk through.
