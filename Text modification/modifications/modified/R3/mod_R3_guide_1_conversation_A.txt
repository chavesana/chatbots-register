hello. what is there for me to help you with?
what kind of restaurant are you looking for? (italian, indian, diner, bbq etc) we have a wide variety of local restaurants for you to choose from.
okay! some good sandwich places i have been to are aspen deli, ProperM, provisions downtown, there is also crystal creek sandwich company on milton rd.
well these are local, ProperM sources products from the region. it costs a bit more ($12 for a sandwich vs. 6/7) but are worth it.
aspen deli is a family-run businesswith delicious sandwiches.
i'm here to help you!
