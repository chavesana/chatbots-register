hello. what is there for me to help you with?
there is some parking, but there is a parking lot that accommodates rvs.
this time of year, you should not have any trouble finding rv parking. parking is complimentary, though it is a national monument so there is a park entrance fee. do you have a national parks pass?
perfect! that will cover everyone in the vehicle, so you do not have to pay the entrance fee.
i'm here to help you
