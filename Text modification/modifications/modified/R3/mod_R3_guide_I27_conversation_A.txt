Hello.
the majority of downtown is $1/hour to park, excluding the american valet-run parking lots, that are more expensive. you can park at the visitor center for 30 minutes for free 8-5pm, outside of those hours there is no charge to park. you can park a few blocks north/west of downtown on neighborhood streets for free.
