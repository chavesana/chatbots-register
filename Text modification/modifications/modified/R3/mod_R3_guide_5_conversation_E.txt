Hello.
how shall i help?
tell me about your interests. do you like hiking & activities?
there will be of trails within flagstaff to hike - get a flagstaff urban trails map within the visitor's center. there are also mountain biking trails near ft. tuthill county park and on some of the forest service trails.
i would look at our 3 area national monuments - SunsetC, wupatki, and walnutc. plenty of those hikes are shorter, but nice scenery and native artifacts.
humphreys will be challenging to do with a rewarding view, followed by mt. elden. specific elevation gain, mileage, etc. is within the visitor's center. make sure to check weather prior as we frequently have thunderstorms and lightening this time.
to do both, i would check out historic brewing on san francisco or DarkSky brewing on beaver st. for a large menu selection with beer, lumberyard is another choice. look at the ale trail map in the visitor's center.
