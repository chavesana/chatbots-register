hello. what shall i help you with today?
we do not have any zoos in NorthernAZ. the closest you will come across is bearizona in williams, 30 minutes west of flagstaff, which is a drive through wildlife park.
yes it is, but if you are concerned about the car there is a wild ride bus tour option scheduled a couple times a day. something i consider nice about the bus tour is that guides will talk to you about the animals that you view in the park.
Not a problem!
