Hello.
For food or tourist-type attractions?
5pm is when many close at, lowellobs is open until 10 pm to visit. you can drive through SunsetC and wupatki after 5pm, although their visitor centers close.
i think it will be. things might clear up by evening and you can go back to visit for the same price.
