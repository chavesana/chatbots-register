hello. the train to the GrandC leaves from williams, 30 minutes west of flagstaff on i-40. the train here in flagstaff goes east-west along route 66 and goes chicago to los angeles.
you would need to drive/take a taxi to williams, you even take the arizona shuttle there.
Yes, it costs around $35 each way on the shuttle. You might get a better price with a taxi.
i'm here to help you.
