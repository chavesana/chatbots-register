hello. what is there for me to help you with?
i personally love the DesertV watchtower's viewpoint of the grandc. it is at the east entrance to the south rim, not only is the building itself lovely, but you have the choice to watch the colorado river going through the canyon from that point , it is beautiful.
it depends. a tour will obviously limit your time, you will take in a lot more about the GrandC and its history, plus you have the bonus of not needing to drive yourself, so you will focus more on your surroundings. when renting a car, you will set your own schedule if there is a particular location you want to visit you will not be limited by the tour.
that should be the case, when you contact the tour you can ask if the guide goes to the watchtower. two of my recommendations are GrandC adventures and all-star GrandC tours.
i'm here to help you
