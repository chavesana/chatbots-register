hello. what kind of adventure sports are you interested in? we have the flagstaff extreme adventure course south of town at fort tuthill. there are two different courses available, one that is purely ziplining and another that envolves a lot of climbing and obstacles through the trees including some ziplines.
it's a lot of fun to do to do. 14 is old enough for the adult course, though there is a height restriction. i will look over that.
okay. "your child must reach the middle of their palms to a height of 5’11″ (180 cm) while keeping their feet flat on the ground. "
there is this requirement as some of the ropes to grab onto are tall; granted i think a lot kids reach that with their hands.
Yup
i'm here to help you, have fun!
