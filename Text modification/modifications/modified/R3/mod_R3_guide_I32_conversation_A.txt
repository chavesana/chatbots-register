hello. midday is the best time of day to visit AntCanyon, that is when the light shines down directly (like you might notice in many photos from the canyon). you will need to book a tour for upper AntCanyon, the flagstaff visitor center has a list of tour company options that someone will provide you.
the one i remember off the top of my head is ChiefTs's tours.
ahh that will trouble you. upper AntCanyon has a number of ladders as part of the trail. you can look into lower AntCanyon as an alternative. it is not as narrow as the upper canyon, plus there are fewerrestrictions on visitation.
i'm here to help you, have a good day!
