hello. flagstaff was officiallyed in 1881.
hmm i do not number for you, but our flagstaff visitor center gets 91k visitors every year, the number has been rising.
flagstaff is a central hub for NorthernAZ, many of our visitors stay here and do day trips outside of the flagstaff area. for the city itself, there is the route 66 history, lowellobs (where the discovery of pluto was), the museums and national monuments, including our year-round festivals.
i'm here to help you
