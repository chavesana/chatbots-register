yeah but still worth the trip. i recommend you go to the east rim or walk along the rim trails you can look for uncrowded places to go to.
no it is the same as here unless you hike into the canyon
yeah you can. there are some suggestions for day hikes that you can do on whichever, the BrightAngel trail or the hermit trail that you can go to the hiking map. the visitor center is where maps can be picked up at.
i'm here to help you
