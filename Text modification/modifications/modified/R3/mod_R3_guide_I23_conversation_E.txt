how shall i help?
will you tell me more about your interests. do you enjoy beer?
i would recommend getting the ale trail sheet from the visitor's center. it shows the 9 breweries, many in walking distance of downtown. if you get stamps from those places (no purchase necessary) you get a free souvenir glass.
also there is a musical performance starting at 6 pm this evening. the museum of NorthernAZ is where the performance is at.
i am not sure - it is a male/female duo, probably singer-songwriter combo. downtown is safe to walk around. many breweries close on the earlier side anyway (prior to midnight)
it is 2 miles from the visitor's center on ft. valley rd. at humphreys st., you will see signs to for the museum of NorthernAZ
