hello. the GrandC has beautiful views everywhere in the park. some of my favorite viewpoints are at the desertview watchtower on the east side of the canyon, and mohave point. there are shuttle buses that take you to many of the viewpoints, or you have the choice to hike along the rim .
we are getting into the slower season, but "slow" for the GrandC still means thousands of visitors in one day.
My best recommendation is to arrive early
the GrandC has similar elevation as we are here, so it should be the same temperature as flagstaff.
i'm here to help you!
