Hello. What kind of restaurants are you both interested in?
ok. do you want something more middle/high-end? one nice traditional italian pizzaria in downtown has the name pizzicletta. the pizzaria will do personal-sized pizzas and open at 3pm.
That one is in the mid-price point, not expensive.
there is also criollo latin kitchen, which has a great twist but is not exactly mexican food, so it would be different.
i'm here to help you!
