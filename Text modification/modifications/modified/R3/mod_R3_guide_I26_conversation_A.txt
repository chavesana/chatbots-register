hello. yes, the flagstaff visitor center has two city maps. there is the discovery map, that is more for visitors and highlights the important attractions, there is also a map by the chamber of commerce that has the streets on it that is more for relocation.
there are some good ones! downtown has managed to preserve more of the original route 66 buildings than further out in town. shall you stop by the visitor center, there is a route 66 walking tour brochure that you pick up and read about the buildings.
outside of downtown, stop by the MuseumC in east flagstaff. it opened around the same time as route 66 wased, country music still plays there today.
the tunnels still exist, those aren't accessible to the public any more. our local historian, johnny anaya, tried to organize a tour of the tunnels a few years ago, but those have been blocked off and walled up in many places.
i have been down to the basement of blendz, a wine bar on aspen ave, that still has access to its part of the tunnel, but it is not open to the general public.
it is worth stopping in to ask, though!

any other questions from you?
ok, have a good day!
