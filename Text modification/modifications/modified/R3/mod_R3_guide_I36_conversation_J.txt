the first day i'd visit the historic downtown to embrace the town. and then we have some great monuments, walnutc, SunsetC, and wuptkai to visit. great hiking trails from arizona snowbowl and near mount elden. i'd do these activities in the mornings then in the afternoon when it's raining you can go to visit the museum of northernaz, riordan mansion, and pioneer museum.
i'd give a couple hours to each
i'm here to help you
