Hello.
how shall i help?
lowellobs is well liked, as are the three national monuments in the area (walnutc, SunsetC, and wupatki).
people know the museum of NorthernAZ for its native american cultural artifacts.
walnutc is the next exit on the out of town on 40 east. 15 minutes. SunsetC is 19 miles on the out of town on 89 n.
there are a few rim trails around the monument. i would ask for the newspaper behind the desk at the visitor's center for more specifics.
i cannot confirm that information on the website, but monuments have a few rv parking spaces.
