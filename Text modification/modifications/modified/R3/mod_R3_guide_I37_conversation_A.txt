hello. what is there for me to help you with?
the best place to visit for volcanoes would be SunsetC volcano, 30 minutes north of town on 89.
you cannot walk on SunsetC. lenox crater has accessibility and there is a trail to the top of that one, and you will view SunsetC from it.
the lenox crater trail is 1.5-2 hours round trip.
i'm here to help you
