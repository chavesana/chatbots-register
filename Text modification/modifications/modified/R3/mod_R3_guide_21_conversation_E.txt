Hello.
how shall i help?
good to know. i would suggest going to eat at diablo burger for burgers. i would say lumberyard, historic, or DarkSky brewing have good food and beer . do not go to criollo or martanne's.
i would choose one of the hotels near lucky lane. those are not near downtown or the train for you to rest. grab the visitor's guide inside the visitor's center, it will have the phone numbers to make your reservations.
