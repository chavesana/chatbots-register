hello. flagstaff is a university town, so we have what i would describe as a semi-active nightlife scene. there are not any dancing clubs, there are a number of breweries and local bars with music, trivia nights, etc,.
What kind of music do you like?
i like the hotel monte vista for alternative/rock music, and the MuseumC is better for country and two stepping.
country, folk, pop rock, indie
hops on birch will book singer/songwriters to perform, there is a great selection of beers.
oh, another option for you to look at would be the green room.
i will look for you.
all are open on weekdays, it depends on what is booked.
you can go to flagstaff365.com and FlagLive's "pulse" section, which is more centered around music events.
i'm here to help you!
