Hello. What style of food do you like?
there are a number of great mexican restaurants in flagstaff, but you will have to drive. i would recommend agave, salsa brava, and la fonda's are good options.
you can get some mexican food at charly's pub and grill in the weatherford hotel.
charly's has a location downtown, yes.
many of the area attractions close at 5pm, LowellObs is open until 10pm on weekdays, greatfor stargazing.
i'm here to help you!
