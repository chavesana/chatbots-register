hello. doing three of those in one day is possible. dinosaur tracks is in tuba city, so i would start there and making your way back down to flagstaff as you visit each location.
my recommendation is planning at least 1-2 hours at each location.
okay in total, you are looking at 3 hours of driving
Sunset and Wupatki are along the same loop road
i'm here to help you!
