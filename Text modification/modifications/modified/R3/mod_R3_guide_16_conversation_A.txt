hello. with one hour, my recommendation would be visiting downtown flagstaff. you can spend an hour wandering around. indeed the majority of the downtown has kept its original historic buildings, there are also dozens of murals by local artists plus most everything downtown is local.
if you want to go further out, you can go up to LowellObs. it is a 5 minute drive up the hill and there are tours during the day.
it is 30-45 minutes, you can leave whenever plus, wander around on your own .
