hello. AntCanyon is a narrow slot canyon, therefore it is not for anyone with claustrophobia. an alternative would be to do to bryce canyon in utah, which is similar without being so narrow, alternatively the sedona area. both places have red rock formations.
try lower AntCanyon. it is not as narrow as the upper canyon, you will see how that part of the canyon would be with claustrophobia.
Not a problem. Can I help you with anything else?
it is a 4.5 hour drive from flagstaff, 2 hours from page. sedona is 45 minutes south of flagstaff.
ok, i'm here to help you!
