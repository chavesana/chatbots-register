hello. it depends on what you are interested in: history, museums, outdoors, shopping, local, monuments?
Okay.
how long a hike would interest you?
okay!my recommendation would be the fatman's loop/EldenLkt trails in that case. beautiful views and easy to moderate.
this time of year, you can do these hikes in the middle of the day, it is still lovely. it gets pretty cold in the mornings, still that is nice for a midday view of the surrounding area.
i'm here to help you!
