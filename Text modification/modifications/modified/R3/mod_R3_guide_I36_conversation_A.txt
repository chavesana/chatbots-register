hello. what shall i help you with today?
 we have quite a few breweries in flagstaff. is there a particular kind of beer you like?
and do you want to do a brewery tour? a couple offer tours of the facilities.
okay! well. do you want me to to try something eclectic, a good option is DarkSky brewery downtown. makers brew 100 flavors a year.
For more traditional beers, Lumberyard and Mother Road would be good options.
i would recommend giving a call to see. it depends on who has availability. i did a tour of mother road's new brewery facilities last week, it is facinating since the brewery has grown significantly when moving the brewing to the second location on butler ave.
shall you stop by the visitor center, there is a brewery trail passport that you pick up and if you visit the breweries on the list, there is a free beer glass.
not at all, you can spread everything out and you are not required to make a purchase at each location. there are 4/5 in downtown alone.
i'm here to help you! enjoy the breweries.
