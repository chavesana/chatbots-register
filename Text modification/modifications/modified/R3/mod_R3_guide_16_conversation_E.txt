Hello.
the train leaves from williams, az, half an hour from flagstaff. the train leaves in the morning, has live music and play-acting robbery on the way. you arrive at the train depot at the GrandC village, a few short walking minutes from the rim of the GrandC. the train leaves the canyon around 3:45pm
i know you get more legroom and more privacy with the pricier seats.
