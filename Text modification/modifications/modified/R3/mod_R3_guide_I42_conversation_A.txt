hello. what is there for me to help you with?
would you want trails with pavement or without pavement?
ok then i would go for the trails at BuffaloP. it is at the base of the mountains and has a view the whole time.
we have a massive urban trail system with hundreds of miles of trails, and you would pick up a map in the visitor center.
i'm here to help you
