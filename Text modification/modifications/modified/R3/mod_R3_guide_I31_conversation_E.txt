Hello.
there is a weekly happenings calendar inside the visitor's center on the counter. there is also a website <<link>>
there is music this evening and the museum of northern ariona is where it's at.
you might like the MuseumC on rte. 66, that one has more of a line dancing feel to it. the state bar across the street has live music and dancing on extended weekend nights.
yes
