hello. what shall i help you with today?
What are you interested in? History, museums, outdoors, shopping, monuments, etc?
there are two museums north on 180 from downtown, the pioneer museum, which is about theing of flagstaff, and the museum of NorthernAZ, which focuses on native american history in addition to geologic history.
we also have three national monuments in the area. walnutc is 15 minutes east on 40, SunsetC volcano is 30 minutes north on 89, and the wupatki pueblo ruins are another 15-20 minutes after the volcano.
yes, that is true! there are a few ruins there, the largest one had about 100 rooms.
researchers have said that it was used as a major trading hub, as there are artifacts that were there from peoples far south of us in mexico.
the ruin does require a bit of walking, would walking be an issue? there are also lookout points where you can sit on a bench and view the ruins. the trail makes a loop around the ruin, there is pavement with an easy grade.
