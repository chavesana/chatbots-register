Hello.
SunsetC has a number of shorter relatively easy hikes that you will go through lava fields for. i would grab the newspaper inside the visitor's center behind the desk.
you cannot do that since the cinders around it are incredibly loose. i would recommend meteor to look into the inside of a large impact (although that is a huge crater and not a volcano)
