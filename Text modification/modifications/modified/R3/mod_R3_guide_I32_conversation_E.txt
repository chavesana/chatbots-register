Hello.
i would suggest walking around the historic downtown. there are self-guided walking tours inside the visitor's center that will give you a sense of the history of flagstaff that are an hour long to do.
yes - but you will need to park on the other side of the building since there might be 15 minute parking. it's $1 an hour, pay at the kiosk by the green dumpster.
walk up san francisco st to aspen ave. it has been in many films.
