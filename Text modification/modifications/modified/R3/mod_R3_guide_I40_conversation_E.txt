Hello.
how shall i help?
there are some pretty red rocks there and has different scenery than in flagstaff. hiking is an option you might try going to there are some good ones there, but there are also some nice viewpoints to go to. in my opinion, the shopping area is too much sometimes.
you should head down 179 to the red rock scenic highway there are several viewpoints. also SchneblyH has some viewpoints and the airport rd. overlook
lots of iron in there.
