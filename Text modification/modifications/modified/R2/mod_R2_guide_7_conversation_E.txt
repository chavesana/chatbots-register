hello. what is there for me to help you with?
we will have two hour free parking on rte 66, on the streets east of san francisco on the southside, and there is complimentary parking in the neighborhoods west of city hall. payable parking downtown is $1 per hour, you pay with a credit card at the kiosks located throughout downtown by entering your license plate #. the parking system tracks your license plate and knows that you are in the clear (no reciept).
I do not have that information specifically, but hopefully the attached link will help. <link>
starlight on leroux sells used books,15 n leroux st, flagstaff, az 86001, across the street from the visitor's center to the north. anyway you will get a map of flagstaff at the visitor's center to help navigate.
