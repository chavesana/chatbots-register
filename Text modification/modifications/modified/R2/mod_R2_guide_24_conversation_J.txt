flagstaff's establishment was in 1882, so it is 137 years old.
What type of things do you like to do?
for my recommendation, i'd go with the flagstaff urban trail system and BuffaloP or the sinclair wash trail are two easy ones to do. also the area national monuments sunsetc, wupatki and walnutc will be great options for you.
