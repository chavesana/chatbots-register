the GrandC is what brings most of our visitors to flagstaff.
brix restaurant is on north san francisco street, and the place is about three blocks north of downtown.
yeah this would be a nice trip to go on. what you would do is leave flagstaff at 8:57 and it would be an over night train to los angles where you would transfer to a different train and head to santa barbra.
