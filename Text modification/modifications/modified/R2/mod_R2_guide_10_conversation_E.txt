hello. well, for a southwest-style breakfast (on the spicy side) go to martanne's (112 historic rte 66). for frou-frou breakfast with lots of options, i like ToastedOwl (12 s mikes pike st). and tradition breakfast with big portions, go to mike & ronda's the place (21 s. milton).
i would say the GrandC, it's iconic and on many "bucket lists". sedona is closer however (30 minutes vs. 1.5 hours), so without much time, i would say that the red rocks of sedona are worth going to see.
