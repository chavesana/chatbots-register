My name is <Tour Guide A>. To answer your question what kind of food are you looking for?
we have 85 restaurants in downtown. is this for breakfast/lunch? to give you an idea, we have diners, southwest, mexican, italian, pizza, cafes, vegetarian, etc,.
we have some thai restaurants that are great downtown. for traditional thai with fish sauce, swaddee is on aspen ave, then pato thai is right up san francisco st, a half block up from the hotel monte vista.
not a problem! is there anything else for me to help you with today?
Okay! Thank you!
