Hi
the GrandC railway departs from williams each morning and departure is around 9am. it is about a three hour ride to go to the GrandC where you get to get off the train and have about 4 hours to explore the GrandC on your own or you can go on a bus tour to see the canyon during this time. then what you'll do is get back on the train and arrive back in williams at 5:30pm.
