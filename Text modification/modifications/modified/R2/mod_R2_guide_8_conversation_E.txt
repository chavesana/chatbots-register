hello. what is there for me to help you with?
well, many of our tent-only campgrounds will open today in the coconino national forest (closest). some are not opened yet. give coconino national forest a call at (928) 527-3600 to ask which campgrounds and which allow pets. private campgrounds in flagstaff will have a mix of rv and tent sites. hope that helps.
