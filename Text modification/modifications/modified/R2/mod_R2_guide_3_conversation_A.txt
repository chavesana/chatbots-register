what shall i help you with today?
 we will have complimentary food during various festivals and events downtown, namely the monthly art walk. if you are in need, you will find the location of the food bank at 3805 e huntington drive on the east of town.
there are a number of inexpensive food options downtown, though. fratelli's has slices of pizza that are around $3, the pastries at macy's cafe and mozelle's have reasonable prices, too.
any other questions from you?
