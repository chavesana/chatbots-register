Hello there!
there are a couple of sports bars and restaurants downtown. my recommendation would be trying majerle's on route 66/san francisco first, also charly's pub & grill, collins irish pub, the market would likely have the match on.(england scored already in the first 5 minutes!)
it will be an interesting game! any other questions from you?
yes, there is the garden thrift south of the tracks on beaver street/phoenix ave.
there are other thrift stores in driving distance .
