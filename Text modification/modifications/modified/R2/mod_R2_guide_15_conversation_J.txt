what can i help you with?
the museum of NorthernAZ will be 3 miles north of downtown and it is worth it. we have exhibits on the native cultures of our region including the geology and paleontology of our region.
Yes it is interesting and fun to work in this part of the city.
sedona will also be worth a visit. the red rocks in there are beautiful, and in addition the new age arts culture of sedona is unique.
you can park on the east side of the visitor center for $1 per hour, and the west lot is 15 minutes.
no the museum is on highway 180, from the visitor center what you'll do is take a left on route 66, a right on humphreys street and when humphreys ends at highway 180 make another left and then watch for the signs.
well, the admission to the museum is $12 of adults, $10 for seniors or military, and $8 for children.
