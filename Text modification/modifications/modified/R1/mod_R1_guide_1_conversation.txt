Hello there!
What kinds of places do you like to go? Are you looking for nightlife or karaoke for example?
well there are a lot of great options for you in downtown flagstaff for live music, at bars like the state bar and the hotel monte vista. you can go to what activities are going on at www.flaglive.com for music and events.
for different interests, we also have LowellObs, where the discovery of pluto was. the observatory is open until 10pm, there is nighttime viewing of the stars and planets through their telescopes.
there is actually a stuffed animal of pluto in the exhibit hall, but the discovery of the dwarf planet, pluto, was at lowell.
haha flagstaff's downtown is safe, with no car i would take a taxi to the observatory since the buses don't go up there due to how steep the hill is to get to it.
it depends on your interests - route 66 is a well liked one, there are route 66 passports at the flagstaff visitor center so you can get stamps along the route in arizona for a bit of a roadtrip.
for somewhere closer, one of my personal favorites is the flagstaff extreme adventure course. you climb through the trees; zipline. there is 5 courses which is a lot of fun.
you can look online, our website is www.flagstaffarizona.org, you can stop in to the flagstaff visitor center in the historic train station during your trip for more information!
Is there anything else I can help you with today?
haha that is perfectly fine!
Have a good evening!
