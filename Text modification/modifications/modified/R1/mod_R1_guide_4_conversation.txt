hello there! my name is <tour guide a>. what shall i help you with today?
What kind of accommodation are you looking for?
okay, we have some options that would fit that. for a hostel, we have the motel du beau and the GrandC international hostel in downtown flagstaff, or for a traditional hotel you can stay at hotels like the super 8, days inn, knights inn, etc. prices for flagstaff hotels change pretty much daily, you can easily search online for prices for any that interest you.
What kind of food do you like?
we have a lot of cuisines in downtown flagstaff.
 there are quite a few breweries in the downtown district, like mother road and the lumberyard, that also serve food. we have great bbq and southwestern style restaurants !
ok that is fine!
there are some good options that are not spicy. we have mix on the square, a soup/sandwich kind of restaurant, beaver street is an american-italian restaurant including being one of our breweries.
the location is 120 n leroux, and the location is right in the center of downtown flagstaff in the OldTown shops.
for that, i would stay at one of the hostels in downtown flagstaff. there are a variety of travellers, international/younger, looking for groups to go places with, and it's a great way to connect with other people.
yes, the two that are downtown are the motel du beau and the GrandC international hostel.
Okay perfect, I'm happy to help!
