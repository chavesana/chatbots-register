hello there! my name is <tour guide a>. what shall i help you with today?
what kinds of things would your family like to do? BuffaloP is a great option for smaller excursions, the trails would be easy for little ones.
there is also the chairlift at the arizona snowbowl that anyone can enjoy.
one moment, i will read through the rest.
ok, so for august there is a chance of monsoons, otherwise it is lovely to go outdoors, hike and mountain bike.
grandc is open year-round, except for government shut downs. we've had issues with that in the past. oftentimes what happens is the roads to the DesertV watchtower close for wintery road conditions.
winter is actually a great time of year to go to the canyon, it's the off-season there will be a lot less travellers there during that time.
that depends on the weather. it's unpredictable here, as we saw this past winter where we barely had any snow, so we can never tell what the weather is going to do. the best thing to do is ask the staff at the GrandC visitor center, or call in the weeks leading up to the trip to review what the trail conditions are like. with little ones, should the rim concern you, i would stay close to the village area and mather point, both are much more secure.
for the cultural events, the museum of northernaz hosts several festivals throughout the year. when you go to the website, www.musnaz.org, and click on "programs & events," you can go to the full list of festivals. beyond that, we do have some national monuments close to flagstaff that are ruins - wupatki are pueblo ruins 45 minutes north of town, and WalnutC is 15 minutes east on 40, and those are cliff ruins.
Okay perfect. I'm glad I could help!
